      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the annals of adventure, there are no more thrilling narratives of
      heroic perseverance in the performance of duty than the record of Spanish
      exploration in America. To those of us who have come into possession of
      the fair land opened up by them, the story of their travels and adventures
      have the most profound interest. The account of the expedition of Portolá
      has never been properly presented. Many writers have touched on it, and H.
      H. Bancroft, in his History of California, gives a brief digest of
      Crespi's diary. Most writers on California history have drawn on Palou's
      Vida del V. P. F. Junipero Serra and Noticias de la Nueva California, and
      without looking further, have accepted the ecclesiastical narrative. We
      have endeavored in this sketch to give, in a clear and concise form, the
      conditions which preceded and led up to the occupation of California.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of California in relation to the control of the Pacific was
      early recognized by the great European powers, some of whom had but small
      respect for the Bull of Pope Alexander VI dividing the New World between
      Spain and Portugal. England, France, and Russia sent repeated expeditions
      into the Pacific. In 1646 the British Admiralty sent two ships to look in
      Hudson's Bay for a northwest passage to the South Sea, one of which bore
      the significant name of California. The voyage of Francis Drake,
      1577-1580, was a private venture, but at Drake's Bay he proclaimed the
      sovereignty of Elizabeth, and named the country New Albion. Two hundred
      years later (1792-1793) Captain George Vancouver explored the coast of
      California down to thirty degrees of north latitude (Ensenada de Todos
      Santos), which, he says, "is the southernmost limit of New Albion, as
      discovered by Sir Francis Drake, or New California, as the Spaniards
      frequently call it." Even after the occupation and settlement by the
      Spaniards, so feeble were their establishments that, as Vancouver reports
      to the Admiralty, it would take but a small force to wrest from Spain this
      most valuable possession. But though the growing feebleness of Spain
      presaged the time when her hold upon America would be loosened, the
      standard of individual heroism was not lowered, and the achievements of
      Portolá and of Anza rank with those of De Soto and Coronado. The
      California explorer did not, it is true, have to fight his way through
      hordes of fierce natives. The California Indians, as a rule, received the
      white adventurers gladly, and entertained them with such hospitality as
      they had to offer, but the Indians north of the Santa Barbara Channel were
      but a poor lot. In a country abounding in game of all kinds, a sea
      swarming with fish, a soil capable of growing every character of
      foodstuff, these miserable natives lived in a chronic state of starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in heroic qualities, so also in skill and judgment, Portolá upholds the
      best traditions of Spain. The success of an expedition depends upon the
      character of the leader. Pánfilo de Narváez landed on the coast of Florida
      in April, 1528, with a well-equipped army of three hundred men and forty
      horses, just half the force he sailed with from Spain the previous June,
      and of the three hundred men whom he led into Florida, only four lived to
      reach civilization&mdash;the rest perished. That is but one example of
      incompetent leadership. When Portolá organized his expedition for the
      march from San Diego Bay to Monterey, many of his soldiers were ill from
      scurvy, and at one time on the march the sick list numbered nineteen men,
      including the governor and Rivera, his chief officer. Sixteen men had to
      be carried, and to three, in extremis, the viaticum was administered; but
      he brought them all through, and returned to San Diego without the loss of
      a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two full diaries of this expedition, one by Father Crespi and
      the other by Alférez Costansó. There is, besides, a diary of Junípero
      Serra of the march from Velicatá to San Diego Bay, a translation of which
      is printed in Out West magazine (Los Angeles), March-July, 1902. It is of
      small value to the student of history. There is a diary by Portolá, quoted
      by Bancroft, and a Fragmento by Ortega, also used by Bancroft. These we
      have not seen. There are letters from Francisco Palou, Juan Crespi and
      Miguel Costansó, printed in Out West for January 1902. The diary of Father
      Crespi is printed in Palou's Noticias de la Nueva California. Documentos
      para la Historia de Mexico, re-printed San Francisco, 1874. The diary of
      Miguel Costansó is in the Sutro library. It has never been printed. It is
      prefaced by an historical narrative, a poor translation of which was
      published by Dalrymple, London, 1790, and a better one by Chas. F. Lummis
      in Out West, June-July, 1901. In Publications of the Historical Society of
      Southern California, Vol. II, Part 1, Los Angeles, 1891, a number of
      documents of the Sutro collection are printed, with translations by George
      Butler Griffin. These relate to the explorations of the California coast
      by ships from the Philippines, the two voyages of Vizcaino, with some
      letters of Junípero Serra, and diaries of the voyage of the Santiago to
      the northern coast in 1774.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sketch here submitted is the result of much study of original
      documents, and the route of the expedition is laid down after careful
      survey of the physical geography where possible, and in other cases, by
      the contoured maps of the Geological Survey, following the directions and
      language as given by the diarists. Among the printed books consulted are
      Palou's Vida del Padre Junipero Serra and his Noticias de la Nueva
      California, above noted. The Conquest of the Great Northwest, Agnes C.
      Laut, New York, 1908; History of California by H. H. Bancroft; Treaties of
      Navigation, Cabrera Bueno, Translation, Dalrymple, London, 1790; The
      Discovery of San Francisco Bay, George Davidson, and Francis Drake on the
      Northwest Coast of America in 1579, the same author; Proceedings of the
      Geographical Society of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of the forthcoming Portolá Festival, The California Promotion
      Committee, through its Reception Committee, appointed three of its members
      to compile a history of the first expedition for the settlement of
      California. In the endeavor to obtain further knowledge of the life and
      character of Portolá, the committee has been enabled, through the efforts
      of one of its members, to have careful search made among the archives of
      Madrid, of the India Office at Saville, of the City of Mexico, and of
      Puebla, and while we have little to show, as yet, concerning Portolá, we
      have received other documents of the utmost importance to the history of
      San Francisco: a chronicle of the events following the discovery of the
      Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      By royal edict, a maritime expedition for the exploration of the
      northwestern coasts of America sailed from San Blas early in the year
      1775. This consisted of the frigate Santiago, under the
      commander-in-chief, Don Bruno de Heceta; the packet boat San Carlos, under
      Lieutenant Ayala, and schooner Sonora, under Lieutenant Bodega. To
      Lieutenant Ayala was assigned the exploration of the Bay of San Francisco,
      while the Santiago and the Sonora sailed for the north. Bodega discovered
      the Bay which bears his name, and Heceta (to spell his name as it is
      usually written) discovered the Columbia River. Bancroft (History of
      California), in giving Palou's Vida as authority for his short and
      incorrect account of Ayala's survey, says: "It is unfortunate that neither
      map nor diary of this earliest survey is extant." It is with pleasure we
      are permitted to present to the public these important documents, now
      printed for the first time, and only regret that the shortness of time
      allowed for their study may perhaps necessitate later some minor
      corrections.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have also received from the Minister of Marine of Spain, Don José
      Ferrano, under date of July 14, 1909, a drawing of the paquebot, San
      Carlos, together with the record of her gallant commander, Don Juan Manuel
      de Ayala.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayala was born in Osuna, Andalucia, on the 28th of December, 1745. He
      entered the Marine Corps on the 19th of September, 1760, and was made
      Alférez de Fragata, October 10, 1767; Alférez de Navio, June 15, 1769;
      Teniente de Fragata, April 28, 1774; Teniente de Navio, February, 1776;
      and Capitan de Fragata, December 21, 1782.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the order for the exploration of the northern coast was made, Ayala
      was one of the officers assigned to the work. He arrived in Vera Cruz in
      August, 1774, proceeded to the City of Mexico, and was ordered by Viceroy
      Bucareli to San Blas, where he was given command of the schooner Sonora.
      The squadron under Heceta had hardly got under way, when the commander of
      the San Carlos, Don Miguel Manrique, suddenly went mad. Ayala was ordered
      to the command of the packet-boat, and returned to San Blas with the
      unfortunate officer, to follow the squadron a few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      In December, 1775, Ayala conducted a reconnaissance on the coast of New
      Spain, and at its conclusion was placed in command of the Santiago, and
      until October, 1778, served the new establishments of California. In
      August, 1779, he was sent to the Philippine Islands in command of the San
      Carlos, returning to San Blas in 1781. In July, 1784, he returned to
      Spain, and on March 14, 1785, was retired, at his own request, the royal
      order granting him full pay as captain of frigate in consideration of his
      services to California. He died December 30, 1797.

    <h2>
      THE MARCH OF PORTOLÁ AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Zoeth S. Eldredge
    </h3>
    <p>
      The popular mind accepts the oft-repeated statement that the settlement of
      California was due to the pious zeal of a devoted priest, eager to save
      the souls of the heathen, supplemented by the paternal care of a monarch
      solicitous for the welfare of his subjects. The political exigencies of
      the day are forgotten; military commanders and civil governors sink into
      insignificance and become mere executives of the priestly will, while the
      heroic efforts of Junípero Serra to convert the natives, his courage in
      the face of danger, his sublime zeal, and his unwearied devotion, make him
      the impelling factor in the colonization of California.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is the popular conception that the church led the way into California
      strange, when we understand that it is to the writings of Fray Francisco
      Palou, friend, disciple, and successor of Junípero, that all historians
      turn for the account of the occupation. Fray Palou details the glorious
      life of the leader with whom he toiled; he eulogizes the worthy priest,
      the ardent missionary, as he passed up and down the length of the land,
      founding missions, planting the vine, the olive, and the fruit tree in a
      land whose inhabitants had often suffered from hunger; giving aid and
      comfort to the sick and weary and consolation to the dying. Indeed, the
      pictures of the padres are fascinating. The infant establishments planted
      by the church grew rich and powerful, but so wise and gentle was the
      administration of the priests and so generous their hospitality, that life
      in California in the first quarter of the nineteenth century was an almost
      dolce far niente existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radiant as is the priestly figure of Junípero drawn by Palou, the careful
      investigator will find that the impelling factor in the occupation of
      California was stern military necessity, not missionary zeal. From the
      time of Cabrillo, Spain had claimed the coasts of the Pacific up to
      forty-two degrees north latitude by right of discovery, but more than two
      hundred years had passed and she had done nothing towards making good this
      right by settlement. The country was open to colonization by any nation
      strong enough to maintain and protect its colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before relating the story of Portolá's march, let us consider for a moment
      the situation of California in its relation to Spain and other European
      nations, and we will then understand why Spain found it necessary to
      occupy the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Legaspi completed the conquest of the Philippines in 1565, he sent
      his flagship, the San Pedro, back to New Spain under command of his
      grandson, Felipe Salcedo, with orders to survey and chart a practicable
      route for ships returning from the Islands. The San Pedro sailed from
      Cebu, June 1, 1565, and took her course east-northeast to the Ladrones,
      thence northward to latitude thirty-eight, thence sailing eastward,
      following the Kuroshiwo, the Black Current of Japan, they made a landfall
      on the coast of California about the latitude of Cape Mendocino. A sail of
      two thousand five hundred miles down the coasts of California and New
      Spain brought the voyagers to the port of Acapulco. This route was charted
      by the priests on board the San Pedro, and for nearly three centuries was
      the one followed by the galleons of Spain sailing from Manila to Acapulco.
      The voyage across the Pacific was a long one and ships in distress were
      obliged to put about and make for Japan. A harbor on the coast of
      California in which ships could find shelter and repair damages was
      greatly desired. A survey of the unknown coasts of the South Sea, as it
      was called, was ordered, and it was also suggested that the explorations
      be extended beyond the forty-second degree of north latitude, it being
      held that the coast was a part of the same continent as that of China, or
      only separated therefrom by the narrow strait of Anian, which was believed
      to open in latitude forty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time the only exploration of the northern coast of California
      was that of Juan Rodrigues Cabrillo, and continued after his death by his
      chief pilot, Bartolomé Ferrelo, in 1542-1543. Cabrillo sailed as far north
      as Fort Ross, anchored in the Gulf of the Farallones, off the entrance to
      the Golden Gate, and then sought refuge from the terrible storms in San
      Miguel Island, Santa Barbara Channel, where he died. Ferrelo took command
      and sailed up to Cape Mendocino, which he named in honor of Don Antonio de
      Mendoza, first viceroy of New Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 17th of June, 1579, Francis Drake, in command of the Golden Hinde,
      took refuge in the bay under Point Reyes, now known as Drake's Bay. He
      took possession of the country in the name of Queen Elizabeth, and named
      it New Albion, because of the white cliffs which, Chaplain Fletcher
      writes, "lie towards the sea," and also "that it might have some affinity
      with our own country." It was in this place and at this time that the
      first English service was held in America, by Master Francis Fletcher,
      chaplain to Francis Drake. The "Prayer Book Cross" in Golden Gate Park,
      San Francisco, commemorates the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake remained in this bay thirty-seven days, refitted his ship, supplied
      himself with wood and water, and sailed on July 23d to the Southeast
      Farallones, where he laid in a store of seal meat, and on the 25th sailed
      across the Pacific for England by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1585, Captain Francisco de Gali, sailing for the Philippines, was
      directed to sail, on the return voyage, as far north as the weather would
      permit, and on reaching the coast of California, examine the land and the
      harbors on his way homeward, make maps of all, and report all that he
      accomplished. It does not appear from Gali's report that he accomplished
      anything in particular. He reached the coast in latitude 37° 30' (Pillar
      Point), and noted that the land was high and fair; that the mountains<a
      href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
      were without snow, and that there were many indications of rivers, bays,
      and havens along the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1594, Captain Sebastian Cermeñon, a Portuguese sailor in the service of
      Spain, sailed for the Philippines with orders similar to those of Gali. In
      an attempt to survey the coast, he lost his ship, the San Agustin. It is
      supposed she struck on one of the Farallones and was beached in Drake's
      Bay. From the trunk of a tree they constructed a boat, called a viroco,
      and in this the ship's company of more than seventy persons continued the
      homeward voyage. The little vessel reached Puerto de Navidad in safety,
      and here the commander and part of the company left it in charge of the
      pilot, Juan de Morgana, with a crew of ten men, who brought it into
      Acapulco on the 31st of January, 1596; a most remarkable voyage of nearly
      twenty-five hundred miles by shipwrecked, sick, and hungry men, crowded
      into an open boat. With the loss of the San Agustin, explorations of the
      California coast by laden ships from the Philippines came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime prior to the summer of 1595, the viceroy of New Spain, Don Luis
      de Velasco, entered into an agreement with certain persons looking to the
      exploration of the coasts of the Californias and the settlement of the
      land. The consideration for this undertaking, which was to be at the
      expense of the adventurers, was the privilege of pearl fishing and trade,
      together with all the honors, favors, and exemptions usually given to the
      pacifiers and settlers of new provinces. Preparations for the expedition
      were under way, when a dispute arose between the leader and his partners
      in the enterprise, and the matter was carried into the courts. Before a
      decision was reached, the leader died, and the judge ordered the other
      partners, among whom was one Sebastian Vizcaino, to begin the voyage to
      the Californias within three months. Under this order, Vizcaino applied to
      Viceroy Velasco, and received his permission to make the journey. This was
      the condition of affairs when, on October 5, 1596, Velasco was relieved
      and a new viceroy, Don Gaspar de Zúñiga y Azevedo, Count of Monterey, took
      command. At Velasco's request, Zúñiga made a careful examination of all
      matters pertaining to the expedition to the Californias, and the result
      was not favorable to Vizcaino. The new viceroy did not think that an
      enterprise which might involve results of such vast importance should be
      entrusted to the leadership of a person of such obscure position and
      limited capital. He also doubted if Vizcaino had the resolution and
      capacity necessary for so great an undertaking, and it appeared to him
      that if disorders should arise among his men through lack of discipline,
      or if the natives of the country to which he was going should repel him,
      the repute and royal authority of the king would be in danger. On the
      other hand, there was the decision of the court, the concession of the
      viceroy, and the fact that Vizcaino had already been at expense in the
      matter. Zúñiga communicated his doubts to the former viceroy, who, in his
      perplexity, submitted the question to a theologian and a jurist, selected
      as the viceroy writes, from the number of those whose opinions were
      entitled to the greatest consideration. Their decision was that the
      concession of the viceroy had the force of an agreement and contract; that
      what was at first a favor had become a right, and that, as the captain had
      manifested no incapacity and had been guilty of no offense, the compact
      could not be varied. The audiencia<a href="#linknote-2"
      name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>, before whom
      Zúñiga also laid the matter, was of like opinion. In view, therefore, of
      the length to which the affair had gone, the viceroy resolved not to annul
      the contract but to do all in his power to insure the success of the
      expedition. That Vizcaino's soldiers might respect and esteem him, the
      viceroy clothed him with authority and showed him the greatest honor. He
      required Vizcaino to furnish him with complete memorandums and inventories
      of the ships and lanchas he intended to take with him, with their sails
      and tackle, the number of people, and the provisions for them, arms,
      ammunition, and all other property, and he instructed the royal officers
      at Acapulco that the expedition must not be permitted to sail until it was
      fully provided with everything necessary for the voyage and the safety of
      the people. The Council of the Indies, on receiving Zúñiga's report,
      ordered him to cancel Vizcaino's commission and select another leader for
      the expedition, but before this order could reach the viceroy, Vizcaino
      had sailed. The expedition consisted of the flagship San Francisco, six
      hundred tons; the San José, a smaller ship, under command of Captain
      Rodrigo de Figueroa, and a lancha. Vizcaino sailed from Acapulco in March,
      1596. His first stop was at the port of Calagua on the coast of Colima,
      where he took on some of his people and stores, and to this point the
      watchful viceroy sent a personal representative to see that Vizcaino
      complied with all of his requirements, and to report on the conduct of his
      soldiers. From here Vizcaino sailed northwest to Cape Corrientes, thence
      northerly to the Islands of San Juan de Mazatlan. From Mazatlan he bore
      west-northwest across the Gulf of California and landed in a large bay
      which he named San Felipe, afterwards known as the Bay of Cerralbo. From
      here he went to La Paz bay, which he so named because of the peaceful
      character of the Indians, who received him hospitably with presents of
      fish, game, and fruits. This was, it is supposed, the place where Jimenez,
      the discoverer of California, lost his life in 1533, and where Córtez
      planted his ill-fated colony two years later. In entering the bay, the
      flagship ran on a shoal, and they were obliged to cut away her masts and
      lighten her of her cargo of provisions, a great part of which was wet and
      lost. Here Vizcaino landed and built a stockade fort, and leaving the
      dismantled flagship and the married men of his company under command of
      his lieutenant, Figueroa, he sailed on October 3rd, with the San José and
      the lancha and eighty men to explore the gulf. He encountered severe
      storms which separated his vessels, and not having proper discipline among
      his men, had trouble with the Indians of the coast, during which nineteen
      men were lost by the overturning of the ship's long boat. He turned back
      to La Paz, where his men, disheartened by the storms and the loss of their
      comrades, demanded to be returned to New Spain. His stock of provisions
      was running low, and putting the disaffected on the flagship and the
      lancha, he sent them back, and with the San José and forty of the more
      adventurous of the men, again sailed, on October 28th, for the headwaters
      of the gulf. For sixty-six days he battled against strong north winds, and
      only succeeded in reaching latitude twenty-nine; then yielding to the
      demands of his men, he sailed for the port of the Isles of Mazatlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of the expedition did not add to Vizcaino's reputation, but he
      made a most glowing report of his discoveries. He told of a land double
      the extent of New Spain and in situation much preferable; its seas
      abounding in pearls of excellent quality and in fish of all kinds, in
      quantity greater than was contained in any other discovered sea; while in
      the interior of the land, some twenty days' journey to the northwest, were
      people who lived in towns, wore clothes, had gold and silver ornaments,
      cloaks of cotton, maize and provisions, fowls of the country (turkeys),
      and of Castile (chickens); thus the Indians told him&mdash;not only in one
      place but in many. He desired permission to make another voyage, and as
      the late expedition had exhausted his own resources, asked that he be
      granted thirty-five thousand dollars from the royal treasury and
      outfitting for his ships. These advances he agreed to repay from the first
      gain received by him during the voyage. He also asked, on behalf of those
      who accompanied him, that the countries brought by him into subjection to
      the crown be given to them encomienda for five lives<a href="#linknote-3"
      name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a>; that they be
      made gentlemen and granted all the favors, exemptions, and liberties that
      other gentlemen enjoy, not only in the provinces of the Indies but also in
      Spain. For these and for other favors asked, Vizcaino agreed to sail with
      five ships, equipped with proper artillery, one hundred and fifty men,
      arms and ammunition, provisions, etc.&mdash;all things necessary for the
      voyage. He would pay the king one-fifth part of all gold, precious stones
      and valuable mineral substances obtained, one-tenth part of the fish
      taken, and one-twentieth part of the salt obtained. He also agreed to make
      discovery of the whole ensenada and gulf of the Californias, take
      possession of the land in the name of his majesty, make settlements, build
      forts, and explore the country inland for a distance of one hundred
      leagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vizcaino's rose-colored report did not deceive the authorities, but as he
      had the necessary outfit and had had some experience, the Council decided
      that he was the best man to head the expedition, though Zúñiga favored Don
      Gabriel Maldonado, of Saville, for commander. The Council ordered that
      Vizcaino be supplied from the royal treasury with all necessary funds; it
      granted the boon of encomienda for three lives, and that the discoverers
      should have all the privileges of gentlemen throughout the Indies. It also
      granted other minor privileges and boons asked for. Vizcaino was made
      captain-general of the expedition, and sailed from Acapulco May 5, 1602,
      with orders to explore the coasts of the Californias from Cape San Lucas
      to Cape Mendocino, or as far north as latitude forty-two. His ships were
      the San Diego, flagship, the Santo Tomas, under Toríbio Gomez de Corvan,
      the Tres Reyes, a small fragata or tender, under Alférez Martin Aguilar,
      and a barcolongo for exploring rivers and bays<a href="#linknote-4"
      name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a>. The chief
      pilot of the expedition was Francisco Bolaños who had been one of the
      pilots with Cermeñon on the lost San Agustin. Three barefooted Carmelites
      looked after the spiritual needs of the adventurers. The story of this
      second voyage of Vizcaino is well known. On the 10th of November, they
      were in the Bay of San Diego, which Vizcaino named for San Diego de
      Alcalá, whose day, November 14th, they spent in the bay, ignoring the
      name, San Miguel, given it by Cabrillo sixty years before. Later in the
      month he entered and named San Pedro bay, for Saint Peter, bishop of
      Alexandria, whose day, November 26th, it was. He also named the islands
      still known as Santa Catalina and San Clemente. He next sailed through and
      named the Canal de Santa Barbara, which saint's day, December 4th, was
      observed while in the channel, and also named Isla de Santa Barbara and
      Isla de San Nicolas. Passing Punta de la Concepcion, which he named<a
      href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a>,
      Vizcaino sailed up the coast in a thick fog, which lifting on December
      14th, revealed to the voyagers the lofty coast range usually sighted by
      the ships coming from the Philippines. Four leagues beyond they saw a
      river flowing from high hills through a beautiful valley to the sea. To
      the mountains he gave the name of Sierra de la Santa Lucia, in honor of
      the Saint whose day (December 13th) they had just celebrated, and the
      stream he named Rio del Cármelo, in honor of the Carmelite friars.
      Rounding a high wooded point, which he named Punta de los Pinos, he
      dropped anchor in Monterey bay, December 16th, 1602. Here Vizcaino found
      the much desired harbor of refuge, and he named it for his patron, the
      Conde de Monterey. Vizcaino made the most of his discovery, and in a
      letter to the king, written in Monterey Bay, December 28, 1602<a
      href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>,
      he gives a most glowing description of the bay, which is, at best, but an
      open roadstead. The Indians, as usual, told him of large cities in the
      interior, which they invited him to visit, but Vizcaino could not tarry.
      His provisions were almost gone, his men were sick with scurvy, of which
      many had died, and putting the most helpless on board the Santo Tomas, he
      sent her to Acapulco for aid, and sailed, January 3, 1603, with the
      flagship and fragata, for the north. A storm soon separated the vessels
      and they did not see each other again until they met in the harbor of
      Acapulco. Vizcaino was told by the pilot, Bolaños, that Cermeñon had left
      in Drake's Bay a large quantity of wax and several chests of silk, and he
      entered the bay on January 8th to see if any vestiges remained of ship or
      cargo. He did not land, but awaited the arrival of the fragata. As she did
      not appear, he became uneasy, and sailed the next morning in search of
      her. On the 13th, a violent gale from the southeast drove him northward.
      This was followed by a dense fog, and when it lifted, he found himself in
      latitude forty-two&mdash;the limit of his instructions&mdash;with Cape
      Blanco in sight, "and the trend of the coast line onward," he writes,
      "towards Japan and Great China, which are but a short run away." Only six
      of his men were now able to keep the deck, and he bore away for Acapulco,
      where he arrived March 21, 1603. Of the company that sailed with him,
      forty-two had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1606, Philip III, King of Spain, ordered that Monterey be occupied and
      provision made there to succor and refit the Philippine ships. He directed
      that to Vizcaino should be given the command of the expedition. His orders
      were not carried out and Vizcaino sailed instead for Japan, whence he
      returned in 1613, and died three years later.
    </p>
    <p>
      For over one hundred and sixty years, no steps were taken for the
      pacification and settlement of Alta California. The galleons continued to
      make their yearly voyages to the Philippines, and returning, sail down the
      coast within sight of the fair land; but no harbor of refuge was
      established and no attempt was made to colonize the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the Spanish king began to realize that if he would retain his
      possessions in America, some action was necessary for their protection.
      Spanish sovereignty in the Pacific was threatened. The Russians had
      crossed Bering Sea, had established themselves on the coast of Alaska, and
      their hunters were extending their pursuit of the sea otter into more
      southern waters. England had wrested Canada from France and was ready to
      turn her attention to the American possessions of Spain. The Family
      Compact of the Bourbon princes of France, Spain, and Italy had aroused the
      ire of Pitt, then at the zenith of his fame, and he resolved to demand an
      explanation from Spain, and, failing to receive it, attack her at home and
      abroad before she was prepared, declaring that it was time for humbling
      the whole house of Bourbon. A check in the cabinet caused Pitt's
      resignation, but in 1766 he was again restored to power with vigor and
      arrogance unabated.
    </p>
    <p>
      On February 27, 1767, Don Carlos III of Spain issued his famous decree
      expelling the Jesuits from the Spanish dominions. This society had
      established a number of missions in Lower California, and Don Gaspar de
      Portolá, a captain of dragoons of the Regiment of Spain, was appointed
      governor of the Californias and sailed from Tepic with twenty-five
      dragoons, twenty-five infantry, and fourteen Franciscan friars to
      dispossess the Jesuits and turn the California missions over to the
      Franciscans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king having been warned of the advance of the Russians upon the
      northern coasts of California, ordered the viceroy of New Spain to take
      effective measures to guard that part of his dominions from danger of
      invasion and insult. While the viceroy was casting about to find a person
      of sufficient importance and ability to organize and carry out so great an
      undertaking, Don José de Galvez, visitador-general of the kingdom and
      member of the Council of the Indies, offered his services and volunteered
      to go to Lower California and effect the organization and equipment of the
      expedition. His services were eagerly accepted, and Galvez set out from
      the City of Mexico, April 9, 1768, for San Blas, on the coast of New
      Galicia. Before arriving at that port, he was overtaken by a courier from
      the viceroy bringing orders just received from the court directing that a
      maritime expedition should be at once dispatched to Monterey and that port
      fortified. Convening the Junta at San Blas on the 16th of May, 1768, the
      señor visitador laid before them the situation and the wishes of the king.
      He stated that on the exterior or occidental coasts of the Californias,
      Spain claimed from Cape San Lucas on the south to the Rio de los Reyes<a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
      in 43 degrees, though the only portion occupied was from Cape San Lucas up
      to 30° 30'.<a href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
      The civilized or Christian portion of the community (gente de razon&mdash;people
      of reason) did not, he said, number more than four hundred souls,
      including the families of the soldiers of the garrison of Loreto and those
      of the miners in the south; that if foreigners of any nation were to
      establish themselves in the celebrated ports of San Diego and Monterey,
      they might fortify themselves there before the government could receive
      notice of it. In all the Sea of the South that washes the shores of New
      Spain there were no other vessels than the two packet-boats recently built
      in San Blas, the San Carlos and the San Antonio, and two others of small
      tonnage which served the Jesuit missionaries in their communications
      between California and the coast of Sonora. In these few ships consisted
      all the maritime forces which could have been opposed to foreign invasion.
      All this Galvez laid before the Junta, there being present the commandant
      of the department and the army officers and pilots who chanced to be
      there. It was resolved to send an expedition by sea in the San Carlos and
      San Antonio, and orders were made to prepare the ships, while Galvez
      proceeded to the peninsula to attend to the gathering of supplies and
      provisions. All the missions of Lower California were laid under
      contribution of vestments and sacred vessels for the new missions to be
      established, also dried fruits, wine, oil, riding horses and mule herd;
      for Galvez had decided to supplement the maritime expedition by one by
      land, lest the infinite risks and dangers attending a long sea-voyage
      should render the attempt abortive. The governor, Don Gaspar de Portolá,
      volunteered to lead the expedition, and he was named commander-in-chief.
      Don Fernando de Rivera y Moncado, captain of the presidio of Loreto, was
      appointed second in command. The troops were composed of forty cavalrymen
      from the presidio of Loreto in Lower California, under Rivera, and
      twenty-five infantrymen of the compania franca of Catalonia, under
      Lieutenant Don Pedro Fages. To the presidial troops were joined thirty
      Christian Indians from the missions, armed with bows and arrows. These
      were intended for the land expedition. The mission of Santa Maria, the
      northernmost mission on the peninsula, was the rendezvous of the land
      forces, and from Loreto four lighters loaded with provisions for the land
      expedition were sent up the gulf to the bay of San Luis Gonzaga, the
      nearest point to the mission of Santa Maria, whither also went by land the
      troops, muleteers, and vaqueros, with the herd of every sort. Finding
      insufficient pasturage for the cattle at Santa Maria, they advanced to
      Velicatá, some thirty miles distant, and here was assembled the land
      expedition. In addition to the officers named, Don Miguel Costansó, ensign
      of royal engineers, was ordered to join the expedition as cosmographer and
      diarist, and Don Pedro Prat was appointed physician. To minister to the
      soldiers and take charge of the missions to be established in the new
      land, the following missionary priests, all of the college of San Fernando
      in Mexico, were named to accompany the expedition. Fray Junípero Serra,
      appointed president of the missions of Alta California, Fray Juan Crespi,
      Fray Fernando Parron, Fray Juan Vizcaino, and Fray Francisco Gomez.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th of January, 1769, at the port of La Paz, the San Carlos was
      loaded and ready for sea. The venerable Father Junípero Serra sang mass
      aboard her, and with other devotional exercises blessed the ship and the
      standards. The visitador named the Señor San José patron of the
      expedition, and in a fervent exhortation, kindled the spirits of those
      about to sail. These were Don Pedro Fages, with his twenty-five Catalans
      of the 1st batallion 2d regiment, Voluntarios de Cataluna, Alférez Miguel
      Costansó, Surgeon Don Pedro Prat, and Padre Fernando Parron. The ship was
      commanded by Don Vicente Vila, lieutenant of the royal navy; the mate was
      Don Jorge Estorace, and twenty-three sailors, two boys, four cooks, and
      two blacksmiths made up the rest of the ship's company&mdash;sixty-two in
      all. They embarked on the night of January 9th and sailed on the 10th.
      Galvez appointed Fages gefe de las armas&mdash;chief of the military
      expedition at sea, and instructed him to retain command of the soldiers on
      land until the arrival of the governor at Monterey<a href="#linknote-9"
      name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a>. On the 15th
      of February, Father Junípero performed like offices for the San Antonio,
      and she sailed the same day under command of Don Juan Perez, "of the
      navigation of the Philippines," carrying Frays Vizcaino and Gomez, some
      carpenters, blacksmiths, and cooks, that, with the sailors, made some
      ninety persons, all told, on both ships. The rendezvous was San Diego bay,
      where all were to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land expedition was divided into two parts. The first division, under
      Rivera, started from Velicatá March 24th, and the second, under command of
      the governor, started May 15th. With Rivera were Padre Crespi, Pilotin
      (Mate) Jose Cañizares. Twenty-five soldados de cuera<a href="#linknote-10"
      name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>, three
      muleteers, and eleven Christian Indians&mdash;forty-two men. With the
      governor marched Junípero Serra, fifteen soldados de cuera, under Sergeant
      Jose Francisco de Ortega, two servants, muleteers and Indians&mdash;forty-four
      in all. The previous day, May 14, 1769, being Easter Sunday, Junípero
      established the Mission of San Fernando with Fray Miguel de la Campa as
      Minister. For the succor and relief of the forces, both sea and land,
      Galvez built, at San Blas, a ship which he named in honor of the protector
      of the expedition, the San Jose, and loading her with supplies and
      provisions, sent her with orders to meet the expedition at Monterey. She
      was lost at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is very little of interest in this march of some two hundred miles
      through a barren country to the bay of San Diego. Junípero's diary lies
      before me<a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a>;
      it is a dreary recital of small incidents of the march, the Indians they
      met, the barrancas they crossed, with pious comments, etc.; no course, no
      distances traveled, or other like information necessary to an
      understanding of the route and country. As a diarist, he is not to be
      compared with Crespi. On June 20th they came first in sight of the sea at
      the Ensenada de Todos Santos; thence their journey was by the sea until
      they came to the rendezvous. As they drew near to San Diego, their Indian
      allies began to desert, evidently in fear of the Diegueños, whom they
      began to meet in numbers and who proved a rascally lot. They thronged the
      camp and became a perfect nuisance with their begging and stealing. They
      begged from Junípero his robe and from the governor his cuera, waistcoat,
      breeches, and all he had on. One of them succeeding in inducing Junípero
      to take off his spectacles to show them to him and as soon as he got them
      in his hands made off with them, causing the priest a thousand
      difficulties to recover them. On the 27th of June Sergeant Ortega, with
      his scouts, pushed on to San Diego and announced to the anxious camp the
      proximity of the governor. Rivera sent ten of his soldiers with fresh
      horses back with Ortega, and Portolá, in advance of his command, reached
      the camp June 29th, and the entire division arrived, June 30th, in good
      order and condition, forty-six days from Velicatá.

      Let us anticipate their arrival and ascertain the fate of the other
      divisions of the expedition. For more than a century and a half the placid
      waters of San Diego bay had lain undisturbed by any craft more formidable
      than the tule rafts (balsas de enea) of the natives, when on the 11th of
      April, 1769, a silent ship slowly entered the bay and dropped her anchor
      not far from the point where now the ferry boat for Coronado leaves the
      slip. It was the San Antonio, the first arrival at the rendezvous. No
      attempt was made to land, for they were alone and dread scurvy had them in
      its grip. Two had died, and most of the ship's company were sick. On the
      29th, the San Carlos arrived, 110 days from La Paz, with her company in
      even worse condition. All were sick, some had died, and only four sailors
      remained on their feet, aided in working the ship by such of the soldiers
      as were able to help. She had been driven far out of her course; had found
      herself short of water, and had to put into the island of Cedros to supply
      herself, and it was with the greatest difficulty she reached the bay of
      San Diego. The first thing to be done was to find good water and to
      minister to the sick. For this purpose there landed, on May 1st, Don Pedro
      Fages, Don Miguel Costansó, and Don Jorge Estorace, with twenty-five
      men-soldiers, sailors, etc., all who were able to do duty, and, proceeding
      up the shore, found, by direction of some Indians, a river of good
      mountain water at a distance of three leagues to the northeast. Moving
      their ships as near as they could, they prepared on the beach a camp,
      which they surrounded with a parapet of earth and fascines, and mounted
      two cannon. Within they made two large hospital tents from the sails and
      awnings of the ships, and set up the tents of the officers and priests.
      Then they transferred the sick. The labor was immense, for all were sick,
      and the list of those able to perform duty daily grew smaller. The
      difficulties of their situation were very great. Nearly all the medicines
      and food had been consumed during the long voyage, and Don Pedro Prat, the
      surgeon, himself sick with scurvy, sought in the fields with a thousand
      anxieties some healing herbs, of which he himself was in as sore need as
      the others. The cold made itself felt with vigor at night and the sun
      burned them by day&mdash;alternations which made the sick suffer cruelly,
      two or three of them dying every day, until the whole sea expedition which
      had been composed of more than ninety men, found itself reduced to eight
      soldiers and as many sailors in a state to attend to the safeguarding of
      the ships, the working of the launches, the custody of the camp, and the
      care of the sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no news whatever of the land divisions. The neighborhood of the
      fort was diligently searched for tracks of a horse herd, but none were
      discovered. They did not know what to think of this delay. At length, on
      the 14th of May, the Indians gave notice to some soldiers on the beach
      that from the direction of the south men mounted on horses and armed as
      they, were coming. It was the first land division under Rivera, fifty days
      from Velicatá, without the loss of a man or having a sick one; but they
      were on half rations; they had only three sacks of flour left and were
      issuing two tortillas<a href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12"
      id="linknoteref-12"><small>12</small></a> per day to each man. Great was
      the rejoicing in the camp of the sick over the arrival of Rivera's force.
      It was now resolved to remove the camp near to the river. This was done,
      and a new camp established on a hill in what is now known as "Old Town,"
      where a stockade was made and the cannon mounted. The surgeon, Pedro Prat,
      devoted himself to the sick, but the deaths continued, until of the ninety
      and more who had sailed from La Paz, two-thirds were laid under the sand
      of Punta de los Muertos<a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13"
      id="linknoteref-13"><small>13</small></a>. It was now thought best to send
      one of the packets to San Blas to inform the viceroy and the visitador of
      the state of the expedition, and it was feared that if this were longer
      delayed, the ship would be unable to put to sea for lack of mariners. The
      San Antonio was selected for this purpose, and was prepared for sea, but
      as she was about to sail, the camp was thrown into an ecstasy of joy by
      the arrival of Portolá and the second division, sound in body, and with
      163 mules laden with provisions. The governor promptly informed himself of
      the condition of affairs, and desirous that the señor visitador's orders
      concerning the sea expedition should be carried out, offered to Captain
      Vila of the San Carlos sixteen men of his command to work the ship, that
      he might pursue the voyage to Monterey. As Vila had lost all his ship's
      officers, boatswain, storekeeper, coxswain of the launch, and there was
      not a sailor among the men offered by Portolá, he declined to go to sea
      under such conditions. All the available sailors were therefore placed on
      board the San Antonio, and she sailed for San Blas, June 8th, with eight
      men only for a crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor now proceeded to organize his force for the march to
      Monterey. He determined to move at once, lest the advancing season should
      expose them to the danger of having the passes of the sierra closed by
      snow, as even at San Diego those who came by sea reported the sierras
      covered with snow on their arrival in April.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 14th of July, Portolá began his march to Monterey, distant one
      hundred and fifty-nine leagues. His force consisted of Sergeant Ortega,
      with twenty-seven soldados de cuera under Rivera, Fages with six Catalan
      volunteers&mdash;all that could travel, Ensign Costansó, the priests,
      Crespi and Gomez, seven muleteers, fifteen Christian Indians from the
      missions of Lower California, and two servants&mdash;sixty-four in all.
      Both Fages and Costansó were sick with scurvy, but joined the command
      notwithstanding. The personnel of this expedition contains some of the
      best known names in California. Portolá, the first governor; Rivera,
      comandante of California from 1773 to 1777, killed in the Yuma revolt on
      the Colorado in 1781; Fages, first comandante of California, 1769-1773,
      governor, 1782-1790; Ortega, pathfinder, explorer, discoverer of the
      Golden Gate and of Carquines Strait<a href="#linknote-14"
      name="linknoteref-14" id="linknoteref-14"><small>14</small></a>;
      lieutenant and brevet captain, comandante of the presidio of San Diego, of
      Santa Barbara, and of Monterey; founder of the presidio of Santa Barbara
      and of the missions of San Juan Capistrano and San Buenaventura. Among the
      rank and file were men whose names are not less known: Pedro Amador, who
      gave his name to Amador county; Juan Bautista Alvarado, grandfather of
      Governor Alvarado; José Raimundo Carrillo, later alférez, lieutenant, and
      captain, comandante of the presidio of Monterey, of Santa Barbara, and of
      San Diego, and founder of the great Carrillo family; José Antonio Yorba,
      sergeant of Catalonia volunteers, founder of the family of that name and
      grantee of the Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana; Pablo de Cota, José Ignacio
      Oliveras, José Maria Soberanes, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At San Diego, Portolá left the sick under the care of the faithful
      surgeon, Prat, and a guard of ten cuera soldiers; Captain Vila of the San
      Carlos, with a few seamen; Frays Junípero Serra, Juan Vizcaino, and
      Fernando Parron, a carpenter, a blacksmith, and a few Lower California
      Indians, some forty persons in all. The governor also left with them a
      sufficient number of horses and mules and about sixty loads<a
      href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15" id="linknoteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
      of provisions. On July 16th, two days after the Portolá expedition
      started, Junípero founded, with appropriate ceremonies, the mission of San
      Diego de Alcalá, the first mission established in Alta California. The
      deaths continued, and before Portolá's return in January, eight soldiers,
      four sailors, one servant, and eight Indians died, leaving but about
      twenty persons at the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will now follow the governor. Relying somewhat on the supply ship, San
      Jose, which was to meet him at Monterey, but which, as we have seen, was
      lost at sea, and also on the supplies to be brought by the San Antonio,
      the governor, knowing the uncertainties of a sea voyage, took with him one
      hundred mules loaded with provisions, sufficient, he concluded, to last
      him for six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the march the following order was observed. Sergeant Ortega, with six
      or eight soldiers, went in advance, laid out the route, selected the
      camping place, and cleared the way of hostile Indians by whom he was
      frequently surrounded. At the head of the column rode the comandante, with
      Fages, Costansó, the two priests, and an escort of six Catalonia
      volunteers; next came the sappers and miners, composed of Indians, with
      spades, mattocks, crowbars, axes, and other implements used by pioneers;
      these were followed by the main body divided into four bands of
      pack-animals, each with its muleteers and a guard of presidial soldiers.
      The last was the rear guard, commanded by Captain Rivera, convoying the
      spare horses and mules (caballada y mulada).
    </p>
    <p>
      The presidial soldiers were provided with two kinds of arms, offensive and
      defensive. The defensive consisted of the cuera (leather jacket) and the
      adarga (shield)<a href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16"
      id="linknoteref-16"><small>16</small></a>. The first, being made in the
      form of a coat without sleeves, was composed of six or seven thicknesses
      of dressed deer skins impervious to the Indian arrows, except at very
      short range. The adarga was of two thicknesses of raw bulls-hide, borne on
      the left arm, and so managed by the trooper as to defend himself and his
      horse against the arrows and spears of the Indians; in addition, they used
      a species of apron of leather, fastened to the pommel of the saddle, with
      a fall to each side of the horse down to the stirrup, wide enough to cover
      the thigh and a leg of the horseman, and protect him when riding through
      the brush. This apron was called the armas. Their offensive arms were the
      lance, which they managed with great dexterity on horseback, the
      broadsword, and a short musket, carried in a case. Costansó, who was an
      officer of the regular army, bears testimony to the unceasing labor of the
      presidial soldiers of California on this march, and says they were men
      capable of enduring much fatigue, obedient, resolute, and active; "and it
      is not too much to say that they are the best horsemen in the world, and
      among the best soldiers who gain their bread in the service of the king."<a
      href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be understood that the marches of these troops with such a train
      through an unknown country and by unused paths, could not be long ones. It
      was necessary to explore the land one day for the march of the next, and
      the camp for the day was sometimes regulated by the distance to be
      traveled to the next place where water, fuel, and pastures could be had.
      The distance made was from two to four leagues<a href="#linknote-18"
      name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18"><small>18</small></a>, and the
      command rested every four days, more or less, according to the fatigue
      caused by the roughness of the road, the toil of the pioneers, the
      wandering off of the beasts, or the necessities of the sick. Costansó says
      that one of their greatest difficulties was in the control of their
      caballada (horse-herd), without which the journey could not be made. In a
      country they do not know, horses frighten themselves by night in the most
      incredible manner. To stampede them, it is enough for them to discover a
      coyote or fox. The flight of a bird, the dust flung by the wind-any of
      these are capable of terrifying them and causing them to run many leagues,
      precipitating themselves over barrancas and precipices, without any human
      effort availing to restrain them. Afterwards it costs immense toil to
      gather them again, and those that are not killed or crippled, remain of no
      service for some time. In the form and manner stated, the Spaniards made
      their marches, traversing immense lands, which grew more fertile and
      pleasing as they progressed northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expedition followed practically the route which afterwards became the
      Camino Real. Its fourth jornada (day's journey) brought it to the pretty
      valley where later was established the mission of San Luis Rey. They
      called it San Juan Capistrano, but that name was afterwards transferred to
      a mission forty miles north of this place. The command rested here, July
      19th. Resuming the march on the 20th, the sierra (San Onofre), whose base
      they were skirting, drew so near the sea that it seemed to threaten their
      advance, but by keeping close to the shore, they held their way, and on
      the 24th they encamped on a fine stream of water running through a mesa at
      the foot of a sierra, whence looking across the sea, they could descry
      Santa Catalina Island. This was San Juan Capistrano, and here they rested
      on the 25th. On the 28th they reached the Santa Ana river, near the
      present town of that name; a violent shock of earthquake which they
      experienced caused them to name the river Jesus de los Temblores<a
      href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19"><small>19</small></a>.
      July 30th and 31st they were in the San Gabriel valley, which they called
      San Miguel, and on August 1st they rested near the site of the present
      city of Los Angeles. The stop this day, in addition to the needed rest and
      the necessity for exploration, was to give opportunity for the soldiers
      and people of the expedition to gain the great indulgence of Porciúncula.<a
      href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20" id="linknoteref-20"><small>20</small></a>
      The priests said mass and the sacrament was administered. In the afternoon
      the soldiers went to hunt and brought in an antelope (barrendo), with
      which the land seemed to abound. The next day they crossed the Los Angeles
      river by the site of the present city, and named it Rio de Nuestra Señora
      de Los Angeles de Porciúncula<a href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21"
      id="linknoteref-21"><small>21</small></a>. Passing up the river, they went
      through the cañon and came into the San Fernando valley, which they called
      Valle de Santa Catalina de los Encinos&mdash;Valley of St. Catherine of
      the Oaks. Five days they spent in the valley, and crossing the Santa
      Susana mountains, perhaps by the Tapo cañon, they came to the Santa Clara
      river near the site of Camulos, and there rested, August 9th. Portolá
      named the river Santa Clara, which name it still bears, in honor of the
      saint, whose day, August 12th, was observed by them. Five days, by easy
      jornadas, they traveled down the river, and arrived on the 14th at the
      first rancheria<a href="#linknote-22" name="linknoteref-22"
      id="linknoteref-22"><small>22</small></a> of the Channel Indians. It being
      the vespers of the feast of La Asuncion de Nuestra Señora, Portolá named
      the village La Asuncion. It contained about thirty large, well-constructed
      houses of clay and rushes, and each house held three or four families.
      These Indians were of good size, well-formed, active, industrious, and
      very skillful in constructing boats, wooden bowls, and other articles.
      Portolá thought this pueblo must be the one named by Cabrillo, Pueblo de
      Canoas (Pueblo of the Boats). This was the site selected for the mission
      of San Buenaventura, founded March 31, 1782. The natives received them
      kindly, gave them an abundance of food, and showed them their well-made
      boats, twenty-four feet long, made of pine boards tied together with cords
      and covered with asphaltum, and capable of carrying ten men each. The next
      four days they followed the beach and camped, on August 18th, at a large
      laguna, called by them La Laguna de la Concepcion. This was the site of
      the future presidio and mission of Santa Barbara. Everywhere were large
      populous rancherías of the Indians, and everywhere they were received in
      the most hospitable manner and provided with more food than they could
      eat. The next stop was three leagues beyond, on the shore of a large
      lagoon and marsh, containing a good-sized island on which was a large
      ranchería, while four others lined the banks of the lagoon. Portolá gave
      to this group the name In Mediaciones de las Rancherías de Mescaltitan&mdash;The
      Contiguous Rancherías of Mescaltitan. The name of Mescaltitan is still
      attached to the island, though the marsh is mostly drained and contains
      some of the finest walnut groves in California. On the 28th, they turned
      Point Concepcion and camped just north at a place called by them Paraje de
      los Pedernales. Point Pedernales, about five miles beyond, preserves the
      name. On the 30th they crossed a large river, which they named the Santa
      Rosa, in honor of that saint, whose day it was. This is now the Santa
      Inez, so called from the mission of that name, established on its bank in
      1804. Passing northward along the beach, a sharp spur of the sierra
      jutting out at Point Sal turned them inland through the little pass
      followed by the Southern Pacific Coast Line, and they came, on September
      10th, to a large lake in the northwest corner of Santa Barbara county, to
      which was given the name of Laguna Larga, now known as Guadalupe Lake.
      Three leagues beyond, they camped at a lake named by Costansó, Laguna
      Redonda, but which the soldiers called El Oso Flaco&mdash;The Thin Bear&mdash;and
      it is still known by that name. Here Sergeant Ortega was taken ill, and
      ten of the soldiers complained of sore feet. They rested on the 3d, and on
      the 4th reached the mouth of the San Luis cañon. Here they were hospitably
      received by the chief of a large ranchería, whose appearance caused the
      soldiers to apply to him the name of "El Buchon," he having a large tumor
      hanging from his neck. Father Crespi did not approve of the name which the
      soldiers applied to the chief, his ranchería, and to the cañon leading up
      to San Luis Obispo, and he named the village San Ladislao. As in so many
      cases the good father was unable to make the name he gave stick, the saint
      has been ignored, but Point Buchon, just above Point Harford and Mount
      Buchon, otherwise known as Bald Knob, bear witness to the staying
      qualities of the tumor on the chief's neck. Passing up the narrow cañon of
      San Luis creek, they camped at or near the site of the mission and city of
      San Luis Obispo. From here, instead of proceeding over the Sierra de Santa
      Lucia by the Cuesta pass into the upper Salinas valley, whence the march
      to Monterey would have been easy, they turned to the west and followed the
      Cañada de los Osos to the sea at Morro Bay, which they called El Estero de
      San Serafin. The Cañada de los Osos<a href="#linknote-23"
      name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23"><small>23</small></a>, still so
      called, they named because of a fight with some very fierce bears, one of
      which they succeeded in killing after it had received nine balls. Another
      wounded the mules, and the hunters with difficulty saved their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travelers now marched up the coast until, on the 13th, they came to a
      point where further progress was disputed by the Sierra de Santa Lucia.
      This was where a spur from the sierra terminating in Mount Mars, blocks
      the passage by the beach and presents a bold front, rising three thousand
      feet from the water. Camping at the foot of the sierra, Portolá sent out
      the explorers under Rivera to find a passage through the mountains. During
      the 14th and 15th, the pioneers labored to open a way into the sierra
      through San Carpóforo cañon, and on the 16th the command moved up the
      steep and narrow gulch, with inaccessible mountains on either side. It is
      impossible to follow their route through this rugged mountain range with
      any degree of accuracy. Their progress was slow and painful. On the 20th,
      they toiled up an exceedingly high ridge to the north, and from its summit
      the Spaniards looked upon a boundless sea of mountains, "presenting,"
      writes Crespi, "a sad prospect to us poor travelers worn out with the
      fatigue of the journey." The cold was beginning to be severe, and many of
      the men were suffering from scurvy and unfit for service, which increased
      the hardship for all; yet they did not falter but pressed bravely on, and
      on the 26th emerged from the mountains by the Arroyo Seco, which they
      named the Cañada del Palo Caido<a href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24"
      id="linknoteref-24"><small>24</small></a> (Valley of the Fallen Tree), and
      camped on the Salinas river, which they christened Rio de San Elizario.
      From now on the march is an easy one down the Salinas valley to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day of September, the command halted near the mouth of the
      Salinas river, within sound of the ocean, though they could not see it.
      They were persuaded that they were not far from the desired port of
      Monterey and that the mountain range they had crossed was unquestionably
      that of the Santa Lucia, described by Torquemada in his history of the
      voyage of Vizcaino, and shown on the chart of the pilot Cabrera Bueno. The
      governor ordered the explorers to go out and ascertain on what part of the
      coast they were. On the morrow, Rivera, with eight soldiers, explored the
      coast to the southward, marching along the shore of the very port they
      were seeking, while Portolá, with Costansó, Crespi, and five soldiers,
      climbed a hill from whose top they saw a great ensenada, the northern
      point of which extended a long way into the sea, and bore northwest at a
      distance of eight maritime leagues, while on the south a hill ran out into
      the sea in the form of a point, and appeared to be wooded with pines. They
      recognized the one on the north as the Punta de Año Nuevo and that on the
      south as Punta de Pinos, while between the two lay the great ensenada<a
      href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25"><small>25</small></a>,
      with its dreary sand dunes. This was as laid down in the coast pilot
      (derretero) of Cabrera Bueno, but where was the famous port of Monterey?
    </p>
    <p>
      They thought that perhaps they had passed Monterey in the great circuit
      they had made through the mountain ranges. For three days the search was
      continued. Rivera reported that south of the Point of Pines and between it
      and another point to the south (Point Cármelo) was a small ensenada, where
      a stream of water came down from the mountains and emptied into an estero;
      that beyond this the coast was so high and impenetrable they were obliged
      to turn back, and he believed that it was the same sierra which compelled
      them to leave the coast on the 16th of September.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much perplexed by these reports, the governor called a council of officers
      to deliberate as to the best course to pursue. On Wednesday, October 4th,
      the council met and after hearing mass, the commander laid the matter
      before them. He set forth the shortness of their store of provisions, the
      seventeen men on the sick list, unfit for duty, the excessive burden of
      labor imposed on the rest in sentinel duty, care of the animals, and
      continual explorations, and to the lateness of the season. In view of
      these circumstances, and of the fact that the port of Monterey could not
      be found where it was said to be, each person present was called upon to
      express freely his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Costansó spoke first; Vizcaino had put Monterey in 37°; they had only
      reached 36° 42'; they should not fail to explore up to 37° 30', so as
      either to find the port or decide it did not exist. Fages was for going up
      to 37° or a little more. Rivera thought they should establish themselves
      somewhere. Then the resolute commander determined to go forward and put
      his trust in God. If they found the desired port of Monterey and therein
      the supply-ship San Jose, all would be well. If Monterey did not appear,
      they would find a place for a settlement; but if it should be the will of
      God that all were to perish, they would have discharged their duty to God
      and man in laboring until death in their endeavor to accomplish the
      enterprise on which they had been sent. To this decision all agreed, and
      signed their names to the compact.

      Ortega and his scouts were now dispatched to lay out the route and locate
      camping places for several days in advance, and on the 7th of October, the
      march was resumed. Sixteen sick men had now lost use of their limbs. Each
      night they were rubbed with oil, and each morning they were put into
      hammocks swung between two mules, tandem, and thus carried in the mode of
      travel used by the women of Andalusia<a href="#linknote-26"
      name="linknoteref-26" id="linknoteref-26"><small>26</small></a>. The march
      was slow and painful. Some of the sick were believed to be in the last
      extremity, and on October 8th, the holy viaticum was administered to
      three, who were thought to be dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day they crossed the Rio del Pájaro, which they named because of a
      great bird the Indians had killed and stuffed with straw, and which
      measured seven feet and four inches from the tip of one wing to that of
      the other. It was thought to be a royal eagle, and that the natives were
      preparing it for some ceremony when they were frightened away by the
      approach of the Spaniards. Crespi, who still had a supply of saints on
      hand, gave the river the name La Señora Santa Ana, but again the saint was
      ignored, and the river is known as the Pájaro (Bird). On the 17th they
      crossed and named the Rio de San Lorenzo, at the site of the present city
      of Santa Cruz. On the 20th they were at Punta de Año Nuevo, and camped at
      the entrance of the cañon of Waddell creek. They recognized Point Año
      Nuevo from the description given by Cabrera Bueno, and Crespi estimated
      that it was one league distant from the camp. With good water and fuel,
      the command rested here the 21st and 22d. Both Portolá and Rivera were now
      added to the sick list. Meat and vegetables had given out and the rations
      were reduced to five tortillas of bran and flour per day. Crespi named the
      camp San Luis Beltran, while the soldiers called it La Cañada de Salud. On
      the 23d, they again moved forward, passing Punta de Año Nuevo and,
      traveling two leagues, camped probably on Gazos creek, where was a large
      Indian ranchería, whose inhabitants received them kindly. This camp, which
      was about opposite Pigeon Point, they named Casa Grande, also San Juan
      Nepomuceno<a href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27"><small>27</small></a>.
      The next jornada was a long one of four leagues, and their camp was on San
      Gregoria creek. It began to rain and the command was prostrated by an
      epidemic of diarrhoea which spared no one. They now thought they saw their
      end, but the contrary appeared to be the case. The diarrhoea seemed to
      relieve the scurvy, and the swollen limbs of the sufferers began to be
      less painful. They named the camp Vane de los Soldados de los Cursos, and
      Crespi applied the name of Santo Domingo to it. Unable to travel on the
      25th and 26th, but resuming the march October 27th, they pressed forward.
      The next stop was Purisima creek, two short leagues distant, but the way
      was rough, and the pioneers had to make roads across three arroyos where
      the descents were steep and difficult for the transportation of the
      invalids. On the bank of the stream was an Indian ranchería, apparently
      deserted. The Spaniards took possession of the huts, but soon came running
      forth with cries of "las pulgas! las pulgas!<a href="#linknote-28"
      name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28"><small>28</small></a>" They
      preferred to camp in the open. The soldiers called the camp Ranchería de
      las Pulgas, while Crespi named it San Ibon. On the 28th they camped on
      Pilarcitos creek, site of Spanish town or Half Moon Bay. They named the
      camp El Llano de los Ansares&mdash;The Plain of the Wild Geese&mdash;and
      Crespi called it San Simon y San Judas. Every man in the command was ill;
      the medicines were nearly gone and the supply of food very short. They
      contemplated killing some of the mules. That night it rained heavily and
      Portolá, who was very ill, decided to rest on the 29th. On Monday, October
      30th, they moved forward. Half Moon Bay and Pillar Point were noted but no
      names given. Several deep arroyos were crossed, some of which required the
      building of bridges to get the animals over. They proceeded up the shore
      until a barrier of rock confronted them and disputed the passage. Here in
      a rincon (corner) formed by the sierra and sheltered from the north wind
      they camped while Ortega and his men were sent out to find a passage over
      the Montara mountains. A little stream furnished them with water and they
      named the camp El Rincon de las Almejas, on account of the mussels and
      other shell fish they found on the rocks. Crespi calls it La Punta del
      Angel Custodia. The site of the camp is about a mile north of the Montara
      fog signal. By noon of the next day, October 31st, the pioneers had
      prepared a passage over the bold promontory of Point San Pedro, and at ten
      o'clock in the morning the company set out on the trail of the
      exploradores and made their painful way to the summit. Here a wondrous
      sight met their eyes and quickened their flagging spirits. Before them,
      bright and beautiful, was spread a great ensenada, its waters dancing in
      the sunlight. Far to the northwest a point reached out into the sea,
      rising abruptly before them, high above the ocean. Further to the left,
      west-northwest, were seen six or seven white Farallones and finally along
      the shore northward they discerned the white cliffs and what appeared to
      be the mouth of an inlet. There could be no mistake. The distant point was
      the Punta de los Reyes and before them lay the Bahía ó Puerto de San
      Francisco. The saint had been good to them and with joy in their hearts
      they made the steep and difficult descent and camped in the San Pedro
      valley<a href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29" id="linknoteref-29"><small>29</small></a>
      at the foot of the Montara mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the company thought they had left the Port of Monterey behind but
      would not believe they had reached the Port of San Francisco. To settle
      the matter, the governor ordered Ortega and his men to examine the country
      as far as Point Reyes, giving them three days in which to report, while
      the command remained in camp in the Vallecito de la Punta de las Almejas
      del Angel de la Guarda, as Crespi calls it, combining the two names of the
      camp of October 30th and transferring them to the camp in San Pedro
      valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Thursday, November 2nd, being All Souls day, after mass some
      of the soldiers asked permission to go and hunt for deer. They climbed the
      mountains east of the camp and returning after nightfall reported that
      they had seen from the top of the mountain an immense estero or arm of the
      sea, which thrust itself into the land as far as the eye could reach,
      stretching to the southeast; that they had seen some beautiful plains
      thickly covered with trees, while the many columns of smoke rising over
      them showed that they were well stocked with Indian villages. This story
      confirmed them in the belief that they were at the Port of San Francisco,
      and that the estero described was that spoken of by Cabrera Bueno, the
      mouth of which they imagined they had seen from the Montara mountains<a
      href="#linknote-30" name="linknoteref-30" id="linknoteref-30"><small>30</small></a>.
      They were now satisfied that Ortega would be unable to reach Point Reyes,
      and that three days was not sufficient time to go around the head of such
      an estero. The exploring party returned in the night of November 3d,
      discharging their fire-arms as they approached. They reported that they
      found themselves obstructed by immense estuaries which ran extraordinarily
      far back into the land<a href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31"
      id="linknoteref-31"><small>31</small></a>, but what caused their rejoicing
      was that they understood from the signs of the Indians that at two days
      journey from where they were there was a port in which a ship was
      anchored. On this announcement, some thought that they were at the port of
      Monterey, and that the supply ship San Jose or the San Carlos was waiting
      for them. Crespi says that if they were not in Monterey, they were
      certainly in San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, November 4th, being the day of San Carlos Borromeo, in whose
      honor they had come to establish a royal presidio and mission in the Port
      of Monterey, and also the day of the king, Don Carlos III (que Dios
      guarde), the holy sacrifice of the mass was celebrated "in this little
      valley, beach of the Port (without the least doubt) of my father San
      Francisco." The men feasted liberally on the mussels which abounded on the
      nearby rocks, and which were pronounced large and good, and, in better
      spirits than they had been for some time, they took up their march at one
      o'clock in the afternoon. Proceeding a short distance up the beach, they
      turned into the mountains on their right, and from the summit beheld the
      immense estero o brazo del mar. Then descending into the Cañada de San
      Andres, they turned to the south and southeast, and traveling two leagues
      camped in the cañada at the foot of a hill, very green with low brush, and
      having a cluster of oaks at its base. The next two days they traveled down
      the cañada, coasting the estero, which they could not see for the low
      hills (lomeria) on their left, noting the pleasant land with its groves of
      oak, redwood (palo colorado), and madroño. They saw the tracks of many
      deer and also of bears. The Indians met them with friendly offers of black
      tamales and atole, which were gladly received by the half-starved
      Spaniards. They begged the strangers to go to their rancherías, but the
      governor excused himself, saying that he must go forward, and dismissed
      them with presents of beads and trinkets. On the 6th, they reached the end
      of the cañada, which suddenly turned to the east, and saw that the estero<a
      href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32" id="linknoteref-32"><small>32</small></a>
      was finished in a spacious valley. To the cañada they gave the name of San
      Francisco<a href="#linknote-33" name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33"><small>33</small></a>.
      Traveling a short distance towards the east, they camped on a deep arroyo,
      whose waters came down from the sierra and flowed precipitately into the
      estero. They were on the San Francisquito creek, near the site of Stanford
      University<a href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34"><small>34</small></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having failed to get through to Point Reyes by the ocean beach route,
      Portolá now sent Ortega around by the contra costa giving him four days in
      which to explore the country and find the port containing the supply-ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortega with his exploradores, guided by some friendly Indians from the
      neighboring rancherías, set out after noon on November 7th and returned in
      the night of the 10th. He reported that he had seen no sign of port or
      ship, and was convinced he had not understood the information the Indians
      had tried to convey to him, and that the port of Monterey could not be in
      advance. They also reported that the country they had seen towards the
      north and northeast was impassable for the expedition, for the reason that
      the Indians had burned the grass and, in addition, were hostile and would
      dispute the passage. They said that they had encountered another immense
      estero on the northeast (Carquinez Strait), which also ran far inland and
      connected with the one on the southeast, and that to double it would take
      many leagues of travel<a href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35"
      id="linknoteref-35"><small>35</small></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the absence of the explorers, the people of the expedition were
      compelled for want of meat to eat oak acorns, which caused them much
      suffering from indigestion and fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portolá called a council of officers, on November 11th, to determine the
      best course to pursue. The decision was unanimous to return to the Point
      of Pines and renew the search for the elusive Puerto de Monterey, which
      they believed they had left behind. This was at once acted upon, and the
      command took up the march in the afternoon of that day, returning by the
      route of its coming, and on the 27th camped in sight of the Point of Pines
      at a little lake of muddy water. They had partly subsisted on wild geese
      which they shot, and on mussels gathered from the rocks of the coast. The
      following day, November 28th, they moved across the Point of Pines and
      camped in the cañada of the Cármelo, where was plenty of wood and good
      water from the river. After giving his men a rest, the governor sent ten
      soldiers, under command of Rivera, with six of the Indian pioneers, who
      undertook to guide them by the coast trails, with instructions to
      thoroughly explore the coast to the south and see if the Port of Monterey
      was concealed in some "rincon" of the Sierra de Santa Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploring party returned on Monday, December 4th, at night. They were
      tired out with their travels over the rough mountain trails, and they
      reported that no port of Monterey existed south of their camp; that the
      mountains belonged to the Sierra de Santa Lucia, and that there was no
      passage along the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vizcaino had said that Monterey was just north of the Sierra de Santa
      Lucia. "It is all that can be desired for commodiousness and as a station
      for ships making the voyage to the Philippines, sailing whence they make a
      landfall on this coast. This port is sheltered from all winds * * * and is
      thickly settled with people, whom I found to be of gentle disposition,
      peaceable, and docile; * * * they have flax like that of Castile, and
      hemp, and cotton,"<a href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36"
      id="linknoteref-36"><small>36</small></a> etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander knew not what to think. What should be a great port,
      protected from all winds, was but an ensenada; what should be the Rio
      Cármelo was but an arroyo; what should be great lakes were but lagunillas;
      "and where, too, were the people, so intelligent and docile, who raised
      flax and hemp and cotton?" Costansó says that in their entire journey,
      they found no country so thinly populated, nor any people more wild and
      savage than the few natives whom they met here. It is not strange that
      Portolá failed to recognize, in the broad ensenada, Vizcaino's Famoso
      Puerte de Monterey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of the command was becoming very grave. The food supply was
      almost gone. They had killed a mule, but only the Indians and the
      Catalonians would eat it. The commander called a council of officers, on
      December 6th, and told them the condition of affairs. They had not found
      the port they had come in search of, he said, and had no hope of finding
      it or the vessel that should have succored them; they had but fourteen
      half sacks of flour left; winter was upon them, the cold was becoming
      excessive, and snow was beginning to fall in the mountains. He invited
      free discussion, but postponed the decision until the next day, that all
      might have time for reflection. On December 7th, after hearing mass, the
      junta again met. Some were for remaining where they were until the
      provisions were entirely consumed, and then retreat, relying on the mules
      for food during the journey to San Diego; others thought it better to
      divide the party, one-half to remain and the other return to San Diego.
      Both projects were carefully discussed, and both presented difficulties.
      The prevailing sentiment seemed to favor a return, and the governor
      announced his determination. They would return to San Diego at once, he
      said, for if the snow should close the mountain passes, the whole
      expedition would be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent storm arose in the afternoon, which lasted until the night of
      December 9th, delaying the march.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, December 10th, they began the retreat from Monterey. Before
      leaving Cármelo Bay, they set up a large cross on a little hill on the
      shore of the ensenadita, and on it, cut into the wood, the legend: "Dig;
      at the foot you will find a writing." A message was put into a bottle and
      buried at the foot of the cross. It gave the facts of the expedition, its
      commander, date of starting, the dates of entering the channel of Santa
      Barbara, of passing Point Concepcion, of the passage of the Santa Lucia
      mountains, of the sight of Punta de Pinos, of Point Reyes, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The expedition desired to reach Point Reyes, but some esteros intervened
      which ran far inland, which required a long journey to go around, and
      other difficulties (the chief of which was the want of provisions), made
      it necessary for us to return, believing that the Port of Monterey might
      perhaps be near the Sierra de Santa Lucia, and thinking that we might have
      passed it without observing it. We left the estero of San Francisco on our
      return on the 11th of November. We passed the Punta de Año Nuevo on the
      19th of said month, and reached the second time this Port and Ensenada de
      Pinos on the 27th of the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      It states that from that day to this they have made diligent search for
      the port of Monterey, but in vain, and now, despairing of finding it,
      their provisions nearly gone, they return to San Diego. Then follows the
      latitude at various points as observed by Costansó. It requests the
      commanders of the San Jose or San Antonio, if they, or either of them,
      should be informed of the contents of the letter and the condition of the
      expedition, to sail down the coast as near the land as possible, that the
      expedition might sight and obtain succor from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The march that day was across the Point of Pines, one league and a half,
      and they camped on the shore of Monterey Bay, where they erected another
      cross with an inscription announcing their departure. On the 11th, they
      ascended the Salinas and began to retrace the route of their coming. They
      killed many geese, which relieved their necessities somewhat, and on the
      21st were clear of the Santa Lucia mountains. The hungry soldiers stole
      flour, and to prevent further theft, the comandante divided the remainder
      among them. On the 28th the command was stuck fast in a mudhole near San
      Luis Obispo, and were unable to say mass, though it was a feast day<a
      href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37" id="linknoteref-37"><small>37</small></a>.
      On January 3d, they passed Point Concepcion. Here, among the Channel
      Indians, food was abundant, their severe trials were over, and the health
      of the command improved daily. Instead of following up the Santa Clara
      river, they crossed the Santa Susana mountains, into the San Fernando
      valley, and followed down the Los Angeles river, crossed the Santa Ana,
      January 18th, and reached San Diego, January 24, 1770, with the command in
      good health and without the loss of a man, "with the merit of having been
      compelled to eat the flesh of male and female mules, and with not having
      found the Port of Monterey, which we judged to have been filled up by the
      great sand dunes which were in the place where we had expected to find
      it."<a href="#linknote-38" name="linknoteref-38" id="linknoteref-38"><small>38</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Portolá found a joyful welcome at the little camp at San Diego. Many had
      died, and Junípero and Father Parron were just recovering from scurvy. No
      tidings were yet received from the San Antonio. The commander made a
      careful inventory of supplies, and reserved enough to march to Velicatá in
      case the San Antonio did not appear when the remainder should be
      exhausted. This, he calculated, would be a little after the middle of
      March, and the 20th of that month was fixed as the date of departure, very
      much to the disappointment of the priests. On February 11th Rivera was
      sent to Velicatá with a guard of nineteen or twenty soldiers, to bring up
      the cattle and supplies that had been left there.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sundown of the day before that appointed for the departure, a sail
      appeared in the distance. It was the San Antonio, just in time to prevent
      the abandonment of San Diego. She brought abundant supplies, and Portolá
      prepared for a second expedition in search of the Port of Monterey.
      Captain Vila of the San Carlos declared, when the details of the search
      were related to him, that the place where they erected the second cross
      was the long-lost Port of Monterey.
    </p>
    <p>
      On April 16th the San Antonio sailed for Monterey, carrying Junípero,
      Costansó, Prat, and a cargo of stores for the new mission. On the 17th,
      Portolá set out by land with Fages, twelve Catalan volunteers, seven
      soldados de cuera, Crespi, two muleteers, and five natives. At San Diego
      was left Vila with his mate and five sailors on the San Carlos, Fathers
      Parron and Gomez, with Sergeant Ortega and eight soldados de cuera as
      guard, and Rivera arrived in July with over eighty mules laden with
      supplies, and one hundred and sixty head of cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portolá followed the same route that he took on the retreat from Monterey,
      and on May 24th arrived at the Ensenada Grande under Punta de Pinos, near
      the cross they had erected, December 10th. Selecting a place for the camp,
      Portolá took Fages, Crespi, and a soldier for guard, and went to the cross
      to see if any vessel had visited the spot. They found around the cross a
      ring of arrows stuck in the ground, some of which were decked with
      feathers; others had fish and meat attached to them, while at the foot of
      the cross was a small pile of shell-fish. As Portolá, Fages, and Crespi
      walked along the beach and looked out over the bay and noted its calm and
      placid waters, with its swimming seals and spouting whales, they broke
      forth with one voice, "This is the Port of Monterey which we have sought.
      It is exactly as reported by Sebastian Vizcaino and Cabrera Bueno."<a
      href="#linknote-39" name="linknoteref-39" id="linknoteref-39"><small>39</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering the good water at the camp on the Rio del Cármelo, Portolá
      ordered the expedition to Cármelo Bay by direct line, while he, with Fages
      and Crespi, proceeded around the Point of Pines. They found it well
      covered with pine trees, many of them large enough for masts of a ship.
      They also came upon a grove of cypress at a point beyond (Cypress Point),
      and arrived at camp after a walk of four good leagues. Here they awaited
      the arrival of the San Antonio.
    </p>
    <p>
      On May 31st the paquebot was sighted near Point Pinos. The soldiers made
      signals, to which the ship replied with her guns, and before night had
      dropped her anchor in Monterey Bay, which was pronounced by the sailors to
      be a most famous port.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 3d of June, 1770, under a shelter of branches near the oak where,
      in 1602, Vizcaino's Cármelite friars had celebrated mass, Don Gaspar de
      Portolá, with his officers, soldiers, and people of the land expedition,
      Fray Junípero Serra and Fray Juan Crespi, Don Juan Perez, captain of the
      San Antonio, Don Miguel del Pino, his second in command, together with the
      crew, assembled to establish a presidio and mission. The father president
      chanted the mass and preached from the Gospel, while the musical
      deficiency was made good by repeated discharges from the guns of the San
      Antonio and volleys from the muskets of the soldiers. At the conclusion of
      the religious ceremonies, Don Gaspar de Portolá, governor of the
      Californias, took possession of the country in the name of his majesty Don
      Carlos III, King of Spain, and the presidio and mission of San Carlos de
      Borromeo de Monterey were founded and established, the first presidio and
      second mission in California.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accord with the orders of the visitador-general, Portolá now delivered
      to Lieutenant Fages, as comandante of California, the command of the new
      establishments, sailed on the San Antonio, July 9th, for San Blas, and
      California knew him no more.

    <h2>
      DATA REGARDING DON GASPAR DE PORTOLÁ AFTER HE LEFT CALIFORNIA
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By E. J. Molera
    </h3>
    <p>
      Portolá and Costansó sailed, on July 9, 1770, for Mexico, to give to the
      viceroy an account of their discoveries. Costansó remained in the capital
      and took part in several engineering works, among others, the map of the
      Valley of Mexico and its drainage. Diligent search instituted by the
      writer in Mexico and Spain regarding Portolá's further history, has so far
      discovered little beyond the fact that the commander's return to the
      capital was followed by promotion from Captain to Lieutenant-Colonel in
      the Royal Spanish Army, and his appointment as Governor of Puebla,
      February 23, 1777.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the municipal archives of the city of Puebla, on page 33 of the folio
      covering the years 1776-1783, is the following description of Portolá's
      taking possession of the office as Governor of that city and state:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possession of Governor Portolá."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the session (meeting of February 23d, 1777), the council saw a royal
      title of Political and Military Governor of this city granted by his
      Majesty to Señor Don Gaspar de Portolá, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal
      Army, and also a superior order of his Excellency the Viceroy, Governor,
      and Captain General of this New Spain, in which is stated that said title
      has been forwarded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The President of the Council, standing and uncovered, took the title in
      his hand and kissed it and put it over his head, being a letter from the
      king, our master, and said that he would obey and he did obey its contents
      and in its provisions it was ordered that Lieutenant-Colonel Don Gaspar de
      Portolá be given possession of said office, and for that purpose, said
      noble corporation went out with the heralds to bring him to this hail of
      sessions, and when he was in, a notary-public having certified to his
      identity, he swore to use faithfully and well the office of Governor,
      doing justice, punishing, and not burdening the poor with excessive taxes;
      to keep and cause to be kept, the rights, privileges, royal decrees and
      ordinances, etc."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having signed the oath, the president gave him the cane of Royal justice,
      by which the act of possession was completed."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same volume many decrees and ordinances are signed by Portolá as
      Governor of Puebla.
    </p>
    <p>
      That in the year 1779, Portolá was still Governor of Puebla is proved by
      two original manuscripts in possession of the writer. One is a circular
      official notice to all the head authorities of Mexico, announcing the
      death of Viceroy Frey Don Antonio Bucareli y Ursua, and shown herewith;
      the other is a letter of Don Gaspar de Portolá, dated April 17th, 1779.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letter from the Viceroy of New Spain to Don Julian de Arriaga, Giving an
      Account of the arrival at San Blas of the Packet Boat San Carlos,
      Returning from the Survey of the Port of San Francisco. Document Obtained
      from the Archives of the Indies, Seville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Dear Sir:"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By courier sent to me from San Blas, I have just learned that the royal
      packet-boat San Carlos, under command of Lieutenant of the frigate Don
      Juan Manual Ayala, which with provisions and goods sailed for the harbor
      of Monterey, thence to the port of San Francisco, anchoring on the 6th
      inst. at San Blas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the copies which I send herewith, of the extensive examination made by
      this officer and his pilot, Don José Cañizares, your Excellency will see,
      in detail, all that was found advantageous, and the news obtained gives
      knowledge of all that that vast port contains and the facilities that is
      has to invernate<a href="#linknote-40" name="linknoteref-40"
      id="linknoteref-40"><small>40</small></a> vessels. The docility and gentle
      manners of the heathen that live in its vicinity inspire hopes in the
      utility of the plan, on which I had previously determined, of colonizing
      this land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letter of this officer, a copy of which is also enclosed, confirms
      everything, extolling the grandeur of the view of the port, the water,
      wood, and ballast with which it abounds, and although the climate is
      rather cold, it is healthy and free from the fogs found in Monterey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He gives an account of what happened on his return, and praises the merit
      of the pilot, Don José Cañizares, in discharging the commission entrusted
      to him, and he recommends him to my attention, which I reserve to that of
      the King; at the same time recommending to Your Excellency that you remind
      His Majesty that this pilot is one of the most useful that the Department
      of San Blas has, and that in the voyages he has made has always shown the
      same honor, conduct, and intelligence as on the one just finished with
      such advantage to the service, because of the information and knowledge he
      has shown in the discharge of his duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For his reward, I consider him worthy of the royal bounty, as well as
      Lieutenant of frigate, Don Juan Manuel de Ayala, for his part in such
      important work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the Lord may keep you from harm for many years is my wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exm°. Sr."

      California, and to Examine the Port of San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Junípero Serra had difficulty in obtaining from Commandant Fages
      the soldiers necessary to found the missions that were projected and
      notwithstanding his old age, he decided to go to the capital of Mexico to
      lay before the authorities his troubles. He sailed from San Diego in the
      mail boat San Carlos October 19, 1772, but, stricken by fever in
      Guadalajara, did not reach Mexico till February 16, 1773.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viceroy Bucareli, then in command of the colony, made the orders he
      considered necessary for California, but his orders would have had but
      little effect or would have followed the slow process of all official
      business, had not an outside incident given them force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count de Lacy, then Minister Plenipotentiary of Spain to St. Petersburg,
      communicated to the court in Madrid, that the Russians were exploring the
      coast of America. He corroborated his statement with copies of the
      newspapers of the Russian capital<a href="#linknote-41"
      name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41"><small>41</small></a>. This news
      with the corroborating proofs was sent to Bucareli with the Royal edicts
      of April 11th and September 23, 1773.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this information was to give a better organization to the
      maritime department of San Blas and better regulations for California. It
      was also ordered that a settlement should be made at San Francisco; that
      better means of communication be established between San Diego and
      Monterey, and that an expedition should be sent to ascertain if the
      Russians had made settlements on the coast of California.

    </p>
    <p>
      On the 19th of March, 1775, Lieutenant of Frigate, Don Juan Manuel de
      Ayala had the schooner under his command anchored near the white rock in
      the harbor of San Blas, waiting the sailing of the frigate Santiago to the
      west coast of California, when the commander of the expedition, Don Bruno
      de Ezeta, ordered him to deliver to Lieutenant of Frigate, Don Juan de la
      Bodega y Cuadra, the command of his schooner and take command of the
      packet boat, San Carlos, as her captain, Don Miguel Manríque, was sick and
      unable to make the voyage. Ayala obeyed the order and waited until the
      morning of the 21st, for the return of the launch which carried his
      predecessor to San Blas. He made everything ready on board to follow the
      frigate and schooner and he asked the commander of the expedition, Don
      Bruno de Ezeta, to take in his frigate some brown sugar and provisions
      which he could not accommodate in his boat except on deck where they were
      liable to be damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 3 p. m. of the 21st he sailed from the anchorage of San Blas with the
      wind east-northeast and on the following day came in sight of Isabela
      Island, lying about five miles to the west. On the 23rd he came in sight
      of the Maria Islands and saw the frigate and schooner going to the
      southeast of the islands, where he lost sight of them. Contrary winds and
      calm weather prevented the San Carlos from making any considerable
      progress. On the 26th, Ayala sent his pilot to see if he could obtain some
      water to replace that which had been consumed<a href="#linknote-43"
      name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43"><small>43</small></a>. The pilot
      could not make a landing and consequently did not obtain any water. On
      April 2d, he saw Mazatlan and the packetboat Concepcion. The following day
      he came near the Concepcion, and the captain informed him that he had on
      board the governor of California<a href="#linknote-44"
      name="linknoteref-44" id="linknoteref-44"><small>44</small></a>. From the
      Concepcion Ayala obtained six kegs of water. On the 4th of April a serious
      accident happened to the commander. When his predecessor was taken sick,
      he had a number of loaded pistols. Ayala ordered them placed where they
      could not injure anyone. In doing this, one fell and was discharged, the
      bullet entering the commander's foot between the second and third toes,
      coming out under the big toe. This accident caused him to keep his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 7th of April, Cape San Lucas was seen to the north, distant about
      two leagues. On the 8th, Cape San Lucas was seen to the west, about twelve
      leagues distant. On account of contrary winds, the progress northward was
      very slow. On June 22d, while they were warming some pitch to calk the
      launch, it took fire, but was extinguished before great damage was done.
      On the same day indications of land were noted and some whales were seen,
      which the sailors say is the first sign of land. On the following day they
      saw some seals, which, according to the sailors, was the second sign of
      land. On the 24th, they saw some ducks, which, they say, is proof positive
      of land being near. On the same day land was sighted at 4 p. m.; the North
      Farallones of San Francisco were seen to the north and Point Año Nuevo to
      the southeast. At 7 p. m., the South Farallones were seen at a distance of
      about two leagues to the northeast. The variation of the needle was
      observed and found to be 13° E.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, at 9 a. m., the fog having lifted, land was seen and Point Año
      Nuevo was recognized to the northwest about three leagues distant. At noon
      the sun's altitude was taken, and the latitude found to be 36° 58'. At 3
      p. m. they took bearings to make Point Pinos, but this point could not be
      seen on account of the fog. At 4 p. m. the fog lifted, and at 5 p. m. they
      saw the point which protects the harbor of Monterey. The variation of the
      needle was observed and found to be 12° 58' E. They had some difficulty in
      finding good anchorage, but finally did so on a sandy bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 26th of June, Commander Ayala sent his launch on shore with mail
      and documents, and on its return the vessel was made fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayala remained in the harbor of Monterey till July 26th, during which time
      he unloaded his cargo, took ballast, water, and fuel, mended sails and
      repaired the ship, which needed it badly, the sixth board under water at
      the poop having to be replaced for a length of one and one-half yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got ready to start for the newly-discovered Port of San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting from the shelter of Monterey, situated at latitude 36°° 33',
      longitude 16° 45' W. of San Blas to the newly-discovered Port of San
      Francisco, July 26, 1775.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day it was impossible to sail on account of the wind coming from a
      contrary direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On July 27th, the launch towed the San Carlos until she came to the range
      of a southwest wind and sailed in a northwest direction<a
      href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45" id="linknoteref-45"><small>45</small></a>.
      At noon Point Pinos was seen bearing south 13° distant five miles; at 3 p.
      m. it had disappeared from view. Very soon after, Point Año Nuevo came in
      sight and the land adjoining it, about four or five miles distant. From
      July 28th to August 3d, little progress was made on account of contrary
      winds from the northwest. On August 3d, at 1 p. m., land was seen to the
      east 1/4 northeast, distant about twelve leagues. It was found to be Point
      Año Nuevo. At 7 p. m. another point came into view bearing north 1/4
      northeast, distant about twelve leagues, which was considered to be Point
      Reyes. At 10 p. m., the wind being northwest, the San Carlos steered
      west-southwest and continued in that course until 8 a. m. of the 4th, when
      the bearing was changed to the north-northeast. At noon the sun's altitude
      was taken and the latitude was found to be 37° 11', and longitude 17° 51'
      W. of San Blas. At 6 p. m., August 4th, the southernmost Farallon of the
      Port of San Francisco was seen to the northwest, distant about eight
      leagues. The land to the north was Point Reyes, bearing 4° W., distant
      about fourteen leagues. At half past eleven, considering the coast was
      near, the course was changed to the south-southwest, until 3 a. m. of
      August 5th, when it was changed again to the north-northeast 5° north to
      bring the ship at sunrise to the point it was at sunset of the day before.
      At 5 a. m. four of the Farallones of San Francisco were seen to the
      north-northwest, distant four leagues. Point Año Nuevo was southeast 1/4
      east from twelve to fourteen leagues and Point Almejas northeast 4° east,
      distant three leagues. At 8 a. m., being near land, commander Ayala
      lowered the launch, and in it Pilot Cañizares was sent with ten men to
      search for an anchorage, while the San Carlos continued along the coast.
      At 9 a. m. a strong current was felt, which drove them to sea, but at
      eleven it was observed that the vessel was nearing the coast, which
      convinced the commander that it was due to the tide, and this was
      confirmed by the soundings; in entering the port, as on the first
      occasion, the tide was going out, and on the second one the tide was
      coming in. The altitude of the sun was taken at noon of that day, with the
      utmost care, and the latitude was found to be 37° 42' and the longitude
      17° 14' W. of San Blas. At this time Point Año Nuevo was about fourteen
      leagues distant to the southeast south; the Farallones to the northwest,
      distant four leagues, and Point Reyes north 1/4 northeast, distant four
      leagues. The wind was from the west. At 4 p. m. the vessel was steered to
      the north-northeast, and half an hour later soundings were taken and
      bottom found at sixteen brazas<a href="#linknote-46" name="linknoteref-46"
      id="linknoteref-46"><small>46</small></a> of mud and sand mixed, and
      distant from the mouth about two leagues. At 5 p. m. bottom was found at
      fifteen brazas, with the same kind of bottom material. Sounding was
      continued and the bottom was found to be as noted in the large map. The
      current was so great at the mouth of this port that at 8:30 p. m., with a
      strong wind from the west-southwest with full sails, the current allowed
      them to go not more than a mile and a half per hour, which shows that the
      current must go at least six miles at the middle of the channel. The
      swiftness of the current, the fact that the launch had not returned and
      that night was coming on, made it necessary to seek for an anchorage; this
      was done with great care and precaution; as the force of the wind made it
      necessary to have full sail, it was feared that some of the rigging might
      give way. For that reason, soundings were taken continually with a 20-lb.
      lead, and a line of sixty brazas could not reach bottom, either in the
      channel or near the point. This seemed very strange until it was realized
      that the current was carrying the lead and it did not strike bottom. They
      continued thus until they were one league inside the mouth of the bay and
      a quarter of a mile from the shore, when the wind suddenly stopped.
      Finding that the current was carrying the ship towards the mouth, an
      anchor was thrown overboard, after having made it fast to the big mast so
      that if it did not catch the bottom it would not be lost. It was found
      that the anchor held. Two more anchors were made ready to drop in case the
      big one should drag. When the wind stopped and the current ceased, the
      vessel was found to be in twenty-two brazas, with sandy bottom<a
      href="#linknote-47" name="linknoteref-47" id="linknoteref-47"><small>47</small></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 6 a. m. of August 6, the launch, which had not been seen since sunset
      the day before, came to the vessel. The pilot was asked why he had not
      come to meet the ship when he saw her sailing shoreward looking for the
      entrance of the bay, answered that at 6 p. m. he had seen a suitable
      harbor for the packet-boat to the east of the entrance, and when he
      attempted to go out the whirlpools and eddies caused by the current were
      such that it was impossible to make any progress, as the current carried
      him back towards the shore, so that he determined to stay in the harbor he
      had attempted to leave. This, and the fact that the men were fired out,
      made him wait until 4 a. m., when he again attempted to go out, with the
      same result as before. During his efforts to get out, he saw the
      packet-boat, and putting the bow towards her he had no difficulty in
      reaching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 7 a. m., the commander sent the pilot to examine a harbor which was to
      the west-northwest. He found it useless, because, though it had sufficient
      water, the bottom was sticky mud. As Ayala was not in need of shelter
      then, he did not enter that harbor, as he was afraid of losing his anchor
      in the mud, and also because it was open from the south to the east,
      although the wind came from the landward which was about two leagues from
      the harbor<a href="#linknote-48" name="linknoteref-48" id="linknoteref-48"><small>48</small></a>.
      He called this harbor "Carmeita," because in it was a rock resembling a
      friar of that order. There was in its vicinity an Indian village, the
      inhabitants of which came out from their huts and cried out and made signs
      for the vessel to go near them. As the sailors were taking soundings and
      came near the shore, the Indians erected a pole, at the top of which was a
      large number of feathers. The sailors having no orders to answer them,
      remained at a distance from the shore. The Indians, thinking, no doubt,
      that the sailors were afraid of them, endeavored to assure them by
      dropping their bows to the ground, and after describing a circle in the
      air with the arrows stuck them in the sand. The launch came on board
      again, and soon after, the Indians, from a point of land near the vessel,
      talked to the sailors with loud cries, and although their voices were
      heard distinctly, they could not be understood for want of an interpreter.
      At 9 the launch was sent again to another harbor to the north, which
      seemed to be better sheltered and to have better anchorage<a
      href="#linknote-49" name="linknoteref-49" id="linknoteref-49"><small>49</small></a>.
      It was so, and when the launch returned at 10, the pilot stated that he
      found bottom at eight to fourteen brazas, and the bottom was sticky with
      mud. At 3 p. m. the vessel sailed towards the place examined, but a strong
      current prevented her reaching it. It was then decided to anchor in
      fifteen brazas, sandy bottom, and they stayed there all night, during
      which time the vessel moved on account of the bad quality of the anchors.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 7th, at 9 a. m., the vessel was started towards a large and
      fine-looking harbor which seemed commodious. Soundings were taken, and the
      bottom was found at twelve to fourteen brazas. It had been decided to go
      to the end of it, but the tide was contrary and it was necessary to return
      to the vessel at 1 p. m. Indians from the shore were calling to the men
      with loud cries, and the commander decided to send the launch with the
      priest, the pilot, and armed men, with orders that they must not molest
      the Indians but treat them well and make them presents, for which purpose
      the commander gave the men beads and other trinkets and ordered them to
      observe good precaution, so that in case the Indians showed fight they
      could easily return to the launch, where four armed men must always remain
      to protect the retreat. It is true that from the day when intercourse was
      first had with the Indians, it was seen how affable and hospitable they
      were, showing the greatest desire for the Spaniards to go to their
      village, where, they said, they could eat and sleep. They had already
      prepared on shore a meal of pinole, bread from their corn, and tomales of
      the same. During the time the Spaniards were with the Indians, they found
      that the latter repeated the Spanish words with great facility, and by
      signs the Spaniards asked the Indians to go on board the packet boat, but
      the Indians, also by signs, signified that until the Spaniards should
      visit their village, they could not go on board. After a little while the
      Spaniards returned to the boat and the Indians disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 8th, the pilot, with men, was sent in the launch to explore the
      bay, and on the 9th returned and made his report.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 12th the launch was lowered to look for a better anchorage near
      Angel Island, which is the largest in this bay, and many good places were
      found. It was also thought a good idea to examine another island, which
      was found to be very steep and barren and would not afford shelter even
      for the launch. This island was called "Alcatraz"<a href="#linknote-50"
      name="linknoteref-50" id="linknoteref-50"><small>50</small></a> on account
      of the abundance of those birds that were on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 13th the vessel moved to another anchorage with nine brazas of
      water at pistol shot of the land. On the 21st, the first pilot, Don José
      de Cañizares, returned from an expedition on which he had been sent a few
      days before and made his report. On the same day, the second pilot, Don
      Juan B. Aguirre, went, with fresh men, in the launch to try to find the
      party which the commander of the presidio had promised to send to San
      Francisco by land. The second pilot did not see the party, but explored an
      estero which enters the land about twelve leagues<a href="#linknote-51"
      name="linknoteref-51" id="linknoteref-51"><small>51</small></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 23d fifteen Indians came on a raft and were taken on board, where
      they were entertained and given something to eat. They learned how to ask
      for bread in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day to the 6th of September, the explorations of the Bay of San
      Francisco continued, and first pilot Don José de Cañizares was instructed
      to make his report and the map of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      On September 7th an attempt was made to go to sea for the return voyage,
      but the rudder was injured by a submerged rock on which the current had
      carried the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day to September 18th, the time was passed in repairing the
      rudder and making preparations for the return voyage, which took place on
      that day, going to Monterey, where they arrived the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make the necessary repairs to the ship and pass the equinox in
      good shelter, the San Carlos remained in the harbor of Monterey till
      October 13, 1775, when she started for San Blas, where she arrived on
      November 6th of the same year.

      Report of Don Juan Manuel de Ayala Commander of the Packet Boat San
    </h2>
    <p>
      Carlos to Don Antonio Maria Bucareli Viceroy of New Spain On the
      Examination of the Port of San Francisco
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Excellency:&mdash;I have finished the orders under which I took
      command of the San Carlos, returning to this port of San Blas today,
      November 6th, after having visited the ports of Monterey and San
      Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Your Excellency will see in the account of my examination,
      together with the pilot, Don José Cañizares' report of his examination and
      the map he made of this port, the nature of the work done. I will,
      notwithstanding in this, give a brief account, that shows the port of San
      Francisco to be one of the best that I have seen on this coast from Cape
      Horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      After one hundred and one days of navigation, I arrived at the harbor of
      Monterey, where I had to remain till July 27th, discharging the cargo and
      making some repairs necessary for the safety of my vessel. On July 27th, I
      started in search of the Port of San Francisco, where I arrived on the
      night of August 5th. I remained there forty-four days, inspecting by
      myself, or by my pilot, with all possible accuracy, everything that
      pertains to this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that this port is good, not only for the beautiful harmony that
      offers to the view, but because it does not lack very good fresh water,
      wood, and ballast in abundance. Its climate though cold, is healthful and
      free from those troublesome fogs which we had daily in Monterey, because
      the fogs here hardly reach the entrance of the port, and once inside the
      harbor, the weather is very clear. To these many advantages is to be added
      the best: and this is that the heathen Indians around this port are so
      constant in their good friendship and so gentle in their manners, that I
      received them with pleasure on board several times, and I had the sailors
      frequently visit with them on land; so that from the first to the last
      day, they remained the same in their behavior. This made me present them
      with trinkets, beads, and biscuit; the last they learned to ask for
      clearly in our language.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that this good friendship was a great comfort to us,
      enabling us to make with less fear the reconnaissance that was ordered of
      me. Although in a letter written by Your Excellency to my predecessor, Don
      Miguel Manrique, dated January 2d, I read that it was possible we might
      find in San Francisco the land expedition undertaken by Captain Don Juan
      de Anza; I did not on that account refuse the offer of another small land
      expedition which the Captain of Monterey, Don Fernando de Rivera, made me.
      I did not see either of them while I remained in that port, but I did not,
      on that account, postpone the reconnaissance. I could not do all of this
      in person, because I was convalescing from a serious wound in my right
      foot, received April 3d by the accidental discharge of a double-barrel
      pistol, which Don Miguel Manrique had left loaded in the cabin.
      Notwithstanding this, I am satisfied that Don José Cañizares executed with
      his usual ability everything I entrusted to his care. I therefore state to
      Your Excellency (in order that the merit of his work may not be ignored),
      that as long as he was with me, he acted not only with his usual honesty,
      but showed such great talent in his profession that in the midst of my
      troubles I found him one to entrust with the more delicate points of my
      duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On September 7th, I decided to leave the Port of San Francisco, as I
      considered the reconnaissance completed, and in doing this, having no
      wind, I was carried by the strong current against some rocks, injuring the
      rudder and breaking two female and one male bolts. This obliged me to
      enter a cove, where I repaired as well as possible the accident, and again
      tried to sail forth, a light breeze from the north (the only one I noticed
      in the forty-four days) aiding the sailing. On the 18th, because the
      rudder was injured, and those who had been on this coast before had warned
      me that at this time of year the weather was very severe, I determined to
      pass the Equinox at Monterey, and arrived there on the 19th. At this port
      I found the frigate Santiago. The schooner came October 7th, and I left
      for San Blas on the 13th, where I am sick of my foot, but always desirous
      to obey Your Excellency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pray the Lord to keep the life of Your Excellency many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      San Blas, November 9, 1775.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juan Manuel de Ayala.

      Description of the Newly-discovered Port of San Francisco
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Situated in Latitude 37° 53' North, Longitude 17° 10' West of San Blas
    </h3>
    <p>
      By Lieutenant Don Juan Manuel Ayala
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed about two leagues west-southwest of Point Almejas<a
      href="#linknote-52" name="linknoteref-52" id="linknoteref-52"><small>52</small></a>,
      latitude 37° 42', the following is to be seen: First that it<a
      href="#linknote-53" name="linknoteref-53" id="linknoteref-53"><small>53</small></a>
      is large, with two red barrancas<a href="#linknote-54"
      name="linknoteref-54" id="linknoteref-54"><small>54</small></a>, and
      second, that to the north there are three white rocks at a stone's throw<a
      href="#linknote-55" name="linknoteref-55" id="linknoteref-55"><small>55</small></a>.
      From that point the coast runs north-northeast, forming a small harbor in
      which there are five submerged rocks close to its shore; above it some
      white barrancas<a href="#linknote-56" name="linknoteref-56"
      id="linknoteref-56"><small>56</small></a>, ending in a sloping bill which
      top, to the north, is what is called Angel Point<a href="#linknote-57"
      name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57"><small>57</small></a>. This has
      near it several rocks<a href="#linknote-58" name="linknoteref-58"
      id="linknoteref-58"><small>58</small></a>, the furtherest one a gunshot
      distant. From this point there is a harbor sufficient to accommodate any
      vessel<a href="#linknote-59" name="linknoteref-59" id="linknoteref-59"><small>59</small></a>,
      not only on account of its bottom, but because it is sheltered from all
      winds excepting those from the west-southwest. The middle of this harbor
      is to the northwest, where a copious creek empties<a href="#linknote-60"
      name="linknoteref-60" id="linknoteref-60"><small>60</small></a>; the point
      runs northeast 1/4 east. This harbor, with the one inside of it, which I
      called San Jose<a href="#linknote-61" name="linknoteref-61"
      id="linknoteref-61"><small>61</small></a>, has been found very good, with
      the prevailing winds from the south to the northwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Pt. Almejas to the northwest 1/4 west, four Farallones are seen,
      distant about four leagues. The one southernmost looks like a sugar-loaf.
      To the northwest 1/4 north, at a distance of about twelve leagues, a
      mountain<a href="#linknote-62" name="linknoteref-62" id="linknoteref-62"><small>62</small></a>
      is seen which ends in a low point. According to the records of Sebastian
      Vizcaino and coast pilot of Cabrera Bueno, this is the one called Point
      Reyes. From this point the coast runs east-southeast in the shape of a
      half-moon, open to all winds of the third quarter and ending in two
      barrancas at the foot of which a low point comes out with two submerged
      rocks. This point was called Santiago<a href="#linknote-63"
      name="linknoteref-63" id="linknoteref-63"><small>63</small></a>, and, with
      one called Angel de la Guarda, forms the mouth of the channel of the
      entrance of the port<a href="#linknote-64" name="linknoteref-64"
      id="linknoteref-64"><small>64</small></a>. Following this shore in a
      northeast direction, another harbor is to be found within three small
      rocks near the shore which, in case of necessity, may shelter any vessel.
      This harbor<a href="#linknote-65" name="linknoteref-65" id="linknoteref-65"><small>65</small></a>
      ends on the north with a large, steep, and broken point, at the foot of
      which there is a white farallon to which and to the point I gave the name
      of San Carlos<a href="#linknote-66" name="linknoteref-66"
      id="linknoteref-66"><small>66</small></a>, and with Point San José, which
      is distant about half a league, forms the entrance of this famous port. It
      is to be borne in mind that any vessel that enters or leaves this port
      must take the precaution not to come near San Carlos Point, because in
      this place exist violent whirlpools which make useless the rudder, but
      must take the middle of the channel or sail near the shores of San José
      Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the northeast 1/4 north of the middle of the entrance, an island<a
      href="#linknote-67" name="linknoteref-67" id="linknoteref-67"><small>67</small></a>
      is seen, distant about one and a half leagues. This island divides the
      water of the flood in two channels in which a vessel may anchor,
      especially in the one that runs northeast 1/4 north near the island where
      water and wood are to be found in abundance. The vicinity of the island is
      such good anchorage that a vessel can anchor within a pistol-shot of the
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the east-northeast of Point San José there is a sheltered harbor,
      landlocked, with bottom which diminishes gradually to the shore, where
      water and some wood are to be found<a href="#linknote-68"
      name="linknoteref-68" id="linknoteref-68"><small>68</small></a>. In this
      harbor there is no current, and for that reason, and because it is so near
      the point I consider, it one of the best anchorages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Points San José and San Carlos have been passed, and taking care to
      leave at one side the principal channel, an anchorage can be made at any
      place, because it is sheltered from all winds; the only thing to avoid is
      the current, which in the principal channel is five miles, and in its
      branches three miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This report was made to me by Pilot Don José Cañizares, to whom I
      entrusted the examination of the port, because I was seriously sick.

    <h2>
      Reconnaissance of the Port of San Francisco, with Map
    </h2>
    <p>
      Report of the Pilot Don José de Cañizares to Commander Don Juan de Ayala
    </p>
    <p>
      Translation of a Certified Copy of the Original in the Archives of the
      Indies at Seville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Captain:&mdash;During the four times that I made reconnaissance of
      this Port, and made its map, I found at the northeast and north-northeast
      what is shown on the map and I here describe. To the north-northeast of
      Angel Island, distant about a mile, there is a bay running in a direction
      north-northwest to south-southwest. The distance between the points
      forming said bay, is about two leagues, and the shore line is about two
      and a half leagues. To the northwest of the shore there are three small
      islands, forming between them and the shore a narrow passage of shallow
      water closed to the southwest. This bay is all surrounded with hills with
      few trees, which are mostly laurel and oak, but at a distance to the
      west-northwest, is visible a wood of what seems to be pines. In the middle
      of this bay is standing a high farallon with submerged rocks around it. On
      the northeast of it there is sufficient water for anchorage, as is shown
      on the map. There is no doubt of its being good anchorage for vessels,
      provided they have good cables and anchors, for they are subject to great
      stress because of the current, which at this point, cannot be less than
      four miles an hour<a href="#linknote-69" name="linknoteref-69"
      id="linknoteref-69"><small>69</small></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      North-northeast of said bay there is a mouth about two miles wide, where
      there are four small white rocks, the two north ones with the two south
      ones<a href="#linknote-70" name="linknoteref-70" id="linknoteref-70"><small>70</small></a>
      form a channel of nine brazas depth. From this, one passes to another bay<a
      href="#linknote-71" name="linknoteref-71" id="linknoteref-71"><small>71</small></a>
      more spacious, the diameter of which is about eight leagues, its shape a
      perfect isosceles triangle; its mouth is divided into two channels,&mdash;one,
      on the side of the southwest coast, turns to the northwest at about the
      distance of a mile and ends in two large harbors which are situated in the
      same shore at about four league's distance from the mouth that
      communicates with the first bay; from the northwest point of the furthest
      harbor to the north of it, distant about one and a half leagues, in
      turning a point to the west-northwest, a large body of water<a
      href="#linknote-72" name="linknoteref-72" id="linknoteref-72"><small>72</small></a>
      is seen, which I did not examine because the channel which leads to it is
      extremely limited, its depth not having three codos<a href="#linknote-73"
      name="linknoteref-73" id="linknoteref-73"><small>73</small></a> of water;
      from here to the east-northeast follows a low-lying island, just above the
      water level, ending in a division made by the hills<a href="#linknote-74"
      name="linknoteref-74" id="linknoteref-74"><small>74</small></a>. The other
      channel, which is roomy and deep, runs directly in a northeast direction
      till it reaches the division of the hills through a cañon that runs in the
      same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the bay, which is called the round bay (Bahia Redondo), though it is
      not shaped that way, is surrounded with steep hills, without trees,
      excepting two spots on the slopes fronting the two harbors to the
      southwest. The rest of it is arid, rugged, and of a melancholic aspect.
      Outside of the channels there is in this bay about five codos of water,
      and at low tide two and a half, and in some places it is dry. It is not
      difficult to enter this bay, but going out will be difficult on account of
      the wind from the southwest. After a careful examination of its shore, I
      did not find any fresh water or any signs of it. Standing in the cañon,
      which is to the northeast, there is a channel<a href="#linknote-75"
      name="linknoteref-75" id="linknoteref-75"><small>75</small></a> a mile and
      a half wide, deep and clear. East of its entrance there is a ranchería of
      about four hundred souls. I had dealings with them, but did not buy
      anything, though I presented them with beads, which you had given me for
      that purpose, and some old clothing of mine. Their acquaintance was useful
      to my men and to me, as they presented us with exquisite fishes (amongst
      them salmon), seeds, and pinole. I had opportunity of visiting them four
      times and found them always as friendly as the first time, noticing in
      them polite manners, and what is better, modesty and retirement in the
      women. They are not disposed to beg, but accept with good will what is
      given them, without being impertinent, as are many others I have seen
      during the conquest. This Indian village has some scows or canoes, made of
      tule, so well constructed and woven that they caused me great admiration.
      Four men get in them to go fishing, pushing with two-ended oars with such
      speed that I found they went faster than the launch. These were the only
      Indians with whom I had communication in this northern part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following said channel a distance to the west from its mouth, there is a
      harbor, so commodious, accessible, abundant in fresh water and wood, and
      sheltered from all winds, that I considered it one of the best inland
      ports that our Sovereign has for anchoring a fleet of vessels. I called it
      Puerto de la Asumpta, having examined it the day of the festivity of that
      saint<a href="#linknote-76" name="linknoteref-76" id="linknoteref-76"><small>76</small></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the southeast of this port<a href="#linknote-77" name="linknoteref-77"
      id="linknoteref-77"><small>77</small></a> the cañon continues, until it
      joins the channel of the Indian village. Following a distance of three
      leagues in an east-northeast direction, it enters another bay<a
      href="#linknote-78" name="linknoteref-78" id="linknoteref-78"><small>78</small></a>
      with a depth of thirteen brazas, diminishing to four where some rivers<a
      href="#linknote-79" name="linknoteref-79" id="linknoteref-79"><small>79</small></a>
      empty and take the saltiness of the water which there becomes sweet, the
      same as in a lake. The rivers come, one from the east-northeast (this is
      the largest, about two hundred and fifty yards wide), the other, which has
      many branches, comes from the northeast through tulares and swamps in very
      low land, the channels not over two brazas with sandy bars at their
      mouths, where I found in sounding the water not more than a half braza.
      This made me think they were not navigable, especially as on the second
      occasion I entered them, I touched bottom both in the channels and on the
      bars. The bay where these rivers empty, is another port larger than the
      Asumpta, where any vessel may enter, but it would be difficult to obtain
      wood, which is far from the shore. All the eastern coast is covered with
      trees; that to the west is arid, dry, full of grasshoppers, and impossible
      of settlement. This is all I have reconnoitered to the north of Angel
      Island. To the southeast of said island following the estero is as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      To the east of this island, at a distance of about two leagues, there is
      another, steep and barren, without any shelter, which divides the mouth of
      the channel in two<a href="#linknote-80" name="linknoteref-80"
      id="linknoteref-80"><small>80</small></a>, through which the sea enters to
      a distance of about twelve leagues. The width of this channel is in some
      parts, one, two, and three leagues; its depth is not over four brazas, its
      width ample, but a pistol shot outside of the channel; its depth is not
      over two brazas. The extreme end of this sound, eastward, forms with a
      point, a pocket, which, at low tide is nearly dry<a href="#linknote-81"
      name="linknoteref-81" id="linknoteref-81"><small>81</small></a>. In every
      part there are seen poles driven in (the mud), with black feathers,
      bunches of tule, and little shells, which I believe are buoys for fishing,
      since they are in the water. I think it will be impossible to anchor for
      three leagues inside of this slough, because it is so exposed to the
      weather that strong cables and good anchorage are needed to hold against
      the strong current from the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      The northeast part of this slough is surrounded by high hills, and has in
      its mouth a thick wood of oaks, and at the other end groves of thick
      redwood trees. At the southwest of the coast is a small slough, navigable
      only by launches<a href="#linknote-82" name="linknoteref-82"
      id="linknoteref-82"><small>82</small></a>, and on the coast two harbors<a
      href="#linknote-83" name="linknoteref-83" id="linknoteref-83"><small>83</small></a>
      where vessels can anchor. On the more eastern one there is an Indian
      village, rough, like the ones in Monterey. This part seems to have better
      places for missions, though I did not examine it except from a distance.

      All the above stated in this report is what I observed, saw, surveyed, and
      sounded, during the days, in which by your orders, I went to the
      reconnoitering of this Port of San Francisco in its interior; and as proof
      of it, I sign it in this new Port of San Francisco, at the shelter of
      Angel Island, on September 7th, 1775.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
